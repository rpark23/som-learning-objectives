### Lecture 18: Glomerular Diseases Causing Nephritic Syndrome

**1. List the defining characteristics of a nephritic syndrome.**

Nephritic syndrome reflects an inflammatory injury of the glomerulus. Core clinical features include:
- **Hematuria** (microscopic or macroscopic), often with **RBC casts** and **dysmorphic RBCs** on urine microscopy.
- **Proteinuria** that is typically **subnephrotic** (<3.5 g/day), though overlap (“nephritic–nephrotic”) can occur.
- **Hypertension**, **edema**, and **reduced GFR** leading to **acute kidney injury (AKI)** with possible **oliguria**.
- The **urinalysis (UA) is key** to diagnosis, with the sediment revealing the inflammatory nature (RBC casts/dysmorphic RBCs) distinguishing it from purely proteinuric syndromes.

In contrast, nephrotic syndrome is dominated by massive proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia, and lipiduria; nephritic syndrome centers on hematuria and inflammation-driven AKI.

**2. Formulate a differential diagnosis of a patient with glomerular disease based on clinical presentation.**

Build the differential using clinical context, serologies, complement levels, and targeted biopsy findings:
- **IgA nephropathy/Henoch–Schönlein Purpura (IgA vasculitis):** Often “syn-pharyngitic” hematuria, **palpable purpura**, arthralgias; typically **normal complement**; biopsy shows **mesangial IgA** deposits.
- **Anti-GBM disease (Goodpasture’s):** **Pulmonary hemorrhage** (hemoptysis) plus rapidly progressive AKI; test **anti-GBM antibodies**; biopsy shows **linear IgG** along GBM, **no EM deposits**; often **crescentic GN**.
- **ANCA-associated vasculitis (pauci-immune GN):** Systemic vasculitic symptoms (e.g., pulmonary–renal syndrome), test **ANCA (MPO, PR3)**; biopsy shows **necrotizing crescentic GN** with **negative/minimal IF** and **no EM deposits**.
- **Infection-related GN (post-streptococcal or ongoing infection):** Can follow pharyngitis/skin infection or occur during active bacteremia; often **low C3**; UA with active sediment; biopsy shows **endocapillary proliferation with neutrophils**, **granular “starry-sky” C3±IgG** on IF, **subepithelial “humps”** on EM.
- Use complements to triage: **Low complement** (post-infectious GN, lupus, MPGN, cryoglobulinemia) vs **normal complement** (IgA nephropathy, anti-GBM, ANCA).
- Initial labs often include **ANCA, ANA, anti-GBM, cryoglobulins, complements, hepatitis B/C, HIV, RPR, SPEP**; always scrutinize UA for **RBC casts/dysmorphic RBCs**.

Clinical pearls:
- In pulmonary–renal presentations, urgently send **anti-GBM and ANCA** and examine urine for **RBC casts**.
- In septic patients with AKI, include **infection-related GN** in the AKI differential alongside **pre-renal, ATN (ischemic/toxic), AIN, and post-renal**.

**3. Describe the basic immune mechanisms of glomerular injury.**

Major immune pathways driving nephritic syndromes:
- **Immune complex–mediated GN (e.g., infection-related GN):** Circulating or in situ **immune complexes** deposit in glomeruli, activate **complement**, and recruit inflammatory cells, causing **endocapillary hypercellularity**; IF shows **granular** staining (e.g., **C3-dominant “starry sky”**); EM shows **subepithelial humps**.
- **IgA nephropathy (4-hit hypothesis):**
  1) Production of **galactose-deficient IgA1 (Gd-IgA1)**,
  2) Development of **autoantibodies** to Gd-IgA1,
  3) Formation of **circulating immune complexes**,
  4) **Mesangial deposition** with **mesangial cell activation** and alternate complement pathway involvement, leading to **mesangial hypercellularity** and injury.
- **Anti-GBM disease:** **Autoantibodies to the GBM** (classically the α3(IV) collagen NC1 domain) bind directly to the BM, causing **linear IgG** on IF, **crescentic necrotizing GN**, and can involve the alveolar BM (pulmonary hemorrhage). EM shows **no discrete immune deposits**.
- **ANCA-associated (pauci-immune) vasculitis:** **ANCA** binds to primed **neutrophils**, induces **NETosis** and release of inflammatory mediators within small vessels, causing **necrotizing crescentic GN** with **minimal to negative IF** and **no EM deposits** (injury is mediated by activated leukocytes rather than local immune-complex deposition).

**4. Identify different patterns of injury on glomerular images of light microscopy, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy.**

- **IgA nephropathy:**
  - LM: **Mesangial expansion and hypercellularity**.
  - IF: **Mesangial IgA** (often with C3).
  - EM: **Mesangial electron-dense deposits**.
- **Infection-related GN (post-streptococcal):**
  - LM: **Diffuse endocapillary proliferation** with **neutrophils**.
  - IF: **Granular C3-dominant** “**starry sky**” pattern.
  - EM: **Subepithelial “humps”** (large, dome-shaped deposits).
- **Anti-GBM disease:**
  - LM: **Necrotizing crescentic GN**.
  - IF: **Linear IgG** along the **GBM**.
  - EM: **No discrete deposits**.
- **ANCA-associated (pauci-immune) GN:**
  - LM: **Necrotizing crescentic GN** without marked endocapillary hypercellularity.
  - IF: **Negative or minimal** (“pauci-immune”).
  - EM: **No electron-dense deposits**.

Urine microscopy correlates with active inflammation across these entities: **RBC casts** and **dysmorphic RBCs**.

**5. Describe the various morphologic abnormalities that occur in glomerulonephritis.**

Key morphologic patterns that map to pathogenesis and clinical severity:
- **Mesangial hypercellularity/proliferation:** Increased mesangial cells and matrix (e.g., **IgA nephropathy**).
- **Endocapillary proliferation:** Hypercellularity within capillary loops due to **infiltrating leukocytes** and endothelial swelling (e.g., **infection-related GN**).
- **Extracapillary proliferation (crescents):** Proliferation of **parietal epithelial cells** with **fibrin** in Bowman’s space; hallmark of **rapidly progressive GN (RPGN)** from severe capillary wall injury (seen in **anti-GBM** and **ANCA**).
- **Fibrinoid necrosis:** Severe capillary wall damage with leakage of plasma proteins and fibrin; common in **ANCA** and **anti-GBM**.
- Correlate with clinical course: **RPGN** presents with a **subacute rise in creatinine (days to months)**; without treatment, crescents progress to **scarring**, nephron loss, and **permanent kidney failure**—hence the urgency for **rapid diagnosis** and often **early steroids** while confirming etiology.
