### Lecture 16: Kidney Histology and Histopathology

**1. Identify normal kidney histology.**

The normal kidney is organized into distinct regions with characteristic structures you can recognize on gross and microscopic examination.

- Gross regions:
  - **Cortex**: Defined by the presence of **glomeruli (renal corpuscles)** and their **convoluted tubules**.
  - **Medulla (medullary pyramids)**: Contains **collecting ducts**, **limbs/loops of Henle**, and the **vasa recta**.
  - **Pelvis/calyces**: Lined by **urothelium** at the papilla.
- Nephron organization:
  - **Deep nephrons** have the **longest loops of Henle**.
  - **Medullary rays** in the cortex are bundles of **cortical collecting ducts**, **Henle’s limbs**, and **radial vessels** that run perpendicular to the capsule.
- Tubular histology:
  - Cortex: **Proximal tubules** with a prominent **brush border (microvilli)** that stains magenta with **PAS**; **distal tubules** with less prominent apical specializations.
  - Medulla: Profiles of **loops of Henle** and **collecting ducts**.
  - Papilla: Transition to **urothelium** at the **calyx/pelvis**.
- Vascular landmarks and vulnerability:
  - **Arcuate arteries** sit at the **corticomedullary junction**; there is **no collateral/anastomotic blood supply**, so the **outer cortex** is particularly prone to **ischemia** with reduced perfusion.
  - Loss of an artery at any level causes a patterned **ischemic injury**; loss of a **glomerulus** impacts its local **tubular blood supply**.
- Functional note: The kidneys receive a large fraction of cardiac output to **filter blood** and generate **ultrafiltrate** that is subsequently modified by tubular processes.

**2. Describe normal glomerular microanatomy.**

The glomerulus is a specialized capillary tuft where structure underlies filtration function; understanding the 3D relationships is essential.

- Filtration barrier (three layers):
  1. **Fenestrated endothelium**: Contains **70–100 nm fenestrae**; permits passage of water and small solutes but restricts **cells/macromolecules** and produces **inflammatory mediators** when injured.
  2. **Glomerular basement membrane (GBM)**: A thick, **negatively charged** matrix composed of **type IV collagen**, **laminin**, and **proteoglycans**; functions as a **size and charge filter**, limiting proteins such as **albumin**.
  3. **Podocytes (visceral epithelial cells)**: Have interdigitating **foot processes** bridged by **slit diaphragms** (key proteins include **nephrin**, **podocin**, **α-actinin-4**); provide the final filtration slit and **structural support**. Ultrastructurally, slit diaphragms span adjacent foot processes.
- Other glomerular components:
  - **Parietal epithelial cells** line **Bowman’s capsule** and define **Bowman’s space** (urinary space contiguous with the proximal tubule).
  - **Mesangial cells** regulate **vascular tone**, synthesize **mesangial matrix**, and act as **effector cells** in injury.
  - **Arterioles** and the **juxtaglomerular apparatus (macula densa)** interface with the glomerular pole and regulate nephron function.
- Direction of filtration:
  - Solutes and water pass from the **capillary lumen** through **endothelium → GBM → slit diaphragm** into **Bowman’s space** forming **ultrafiltrate**; **cells and large proteins** remain in the vascular compartment.
- Microscopy correlations:
  - On H&E/PAS/silver stains you can identify **endothelial cells**, **podocytes**, **mesangial cells**, and **parietal epithelial cells**; EM highlights **fenestrations**, **GBM layers**, and **foot processes**.

**3. Describe how pathologic changes in the kidney are evaluated.**

Kidney pathology is assessed by integrating compartment-based morphology with multimodal microscopy to define injury patterns and mechanisms.

- What to evaluate (four compartments):
  1. **Glomeruli**
  2. **Tubules**
  3. **Interstitium**
  4. **Vessels**
  These are anatomically and functionally interdependent, and the kidney has substantial reserve—considerable injury may precede overt functional decline.
- Modalities:
  - **Light microscopy (LM)**: Assesses architecture and patterns of injury.
    - Acute glomerular injury: **Mesangial proliferation**, **endocapillary proliferation**, **cellular crescents (extracapillary)**, **fibrinoid necrosis**.
    - Chronic injury: **Global glomerulosclerosis**, **GBM thickening**, **mesangial matrix accumulation**, **interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IFTA)**; patterns can be **nodular**, **segmental**, or **global** and are largely **irreversible**.
    - Distribution/severity descriptors:
      - **Diffuse** (>50% glomeruli) vs **focal** (<50%).
      - **Global** (entire glomerulus) vs **segmental** (portion of tuft).
    - Capillary wall thickening etiologies: **GBM increase** (e.g., diabetes), **immune complex deposits** (subepithelial, subendothelial, intramembranous), or **mesangial interposition** producing **double contours/tram-tracking**.
  - **Immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy**: Detects **immune complexes** using fluorescently labeled antibodies to **IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, C1q, κ, λ**; patterns and composition guide diagnosis (e.g., “**full house**” staining in immune complex disease).
    - IF pattern:
      - **Linear** capillary wall staining suggests **anti-GBM** antibody disease.
      - **Granular** mesangial/capillary wall staining suggests **immune-complex** deposition (e.g., lupus, membranous, MPGN, IgA nephropathy).
  - **Electron microscopy (EM)**: Localizes **electron-dense deposits** and defines ultrastructural changes.
    - Deposit locations (diagnostically important): **Subepithelial** (between GBM and podocyte), **intramembranous** (within GBM), **subendothelial** (between GBM and endothelium), **mesangial**.
- Mechanisms and categories of glomerular injury:
  - **Immunologic**: **Immune complex–mediated** (intrinsic antigens, planted antigens, circulating complexes) and **cytotoxic antibodies**.
  - **Complement-mediated**.
  - **Cell-mediated** (e.g., cytokine-driven).
  - **Metabolic** (e.g., diabetic glomerulosclerosis).
  - **Structural/hereditary** (e.g., podocyte cytoskeletal gene defects causing **FSGS**).
  - **Mechanical/toxic** (e.g., hemodynamic stress, toxins).
  
Together, LM + IF + EM, interpreted within the four compartments and with precise descriptors of lesion pattern and deposit type/location, provide the framework for diagnosing kidney diseases and correlating morphology with clinical findings.
