### Lecture 15: Application of Renal Physiology

**1. Apply sodium and water physiology to clinical evaluation of patients.**

- The body regulates sodium and water via coordinated hormonal systems:
  - **Angiotensin II (AT II):** In states of volume depletion, AT II increases proximal tubular Na+ reabsorption via the **NHE3** exchanger and stimulates **aldosterone** release, promoting Na+ reabsorption through **ENaC** in the collecting duct.
  - **Aldosterone:** Upregulates apical **ENaC** and **ROMK** and basolateral **Na+/K+-ATPase** to enhance Na+ reabsorption and K+ secretion (especially relevant in hyperkalemia).
  - **ANP:** Increases with elevated atrial pressure and promotes **Na+ excretion** (natriuresis).
  - **ADH:** Adjusts collecting duct water permeability; it is not released with low tonicity/high volume. ADH action determines whether the collecting duct is water permeable.
- Fluid compartment responses:
  - **Isotonic saline (0.9% NaCl):** Increases **ECF volume** without changing tonicity; **ICF** stays the same.
  - **Adding NaCl without water (hypertonic Na load):** Increases tonicity, **expands ECF** and shifts water out of cells, **reducing ICF**; plasma [Na+] rises (e.g., 140 → 145 mEq/L in the worked example).
- Nephron water handling “true/false” highlights:
  - **Thin descending limb:** Water permeable.
  - **Thick ascending limb and distal convoluted tubule:** Water impermeable; reabsorb NaCl without water (diluting segments).
  - **Collecting duct:** Site of fine-tuning for **water, potassium, and acid-base**; water permeability depends on **ADH**.

**2. Apply potassium physiology to clinical evaluation of patients.**

- **Internal balance:** K+ shifts between ICF and ECF:
  - **Insulin** and **β2-adrenergic stimulation** drive K+ into cells.
  - **Acidosis** shifts K+ out of cells; **alkalosis** shifts K+ into cells.
- **External balance:** Renal excretion is controlled mainly in the distal nephron by **aldosterone**, **ENaC-driven lumen negativity**, and **flow-dependent K+ secretion**.
- Clinical applications:
  - Hyperkalemia in CKD/diabetes: contributions include **low GFR**, **ACE inhibitor** use (↓aldosterone), **hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism** in diabetes, **reduced insulin**, and **acidosis** (case with K+ 6.2 mEq/L and peaked T waves).
  - Diuretic effects on K+:
    - **Loop diuretics:** Cause **hypokalemia** and **metabolic alkalosis**; also decrease Ca2+ reabsorption.
    - **Thiazides:** Tend to increase Ca2+ reabsorption.
    - **K+-sparing/MRAs (e.g., spironolactone, amiloride):** Risk of **hyperkalemia**.

**3. Apply acid-base physiology to diagnose acid-base disorders in patients.**

- Terminology:
  - **Acidemia/alkalemia**: Low/high blood pH.
  - **Acidosis/alkalosis processes**: Metabolic (low/high HCO3−) or respiratory (high/low PCO2).
- Stepwise approach:
  1. Anticipate from clinical context.
  2. Determine the “-emia.”
  3. Identify the primary “-osis.”
  4. Calculate **anion gap (AG = Na+ − [Cl− + HCO3−])** and **corrected AG = AG + 2.5(4 − albumin)**.
  5. Check expected compensation to assess for mixed disorders.
  6. If high AG, assess the **delta gap**.
- Compensation formulas:
  - **Metabolic acidosis:** **Winter’s formula** PCO2 ≈ 1.5 × HCO3− + 8 ± 2.
  - **Metabolic alkalosis:** ΔPCO2 ≈ 0.7 × ΔHCO3− (PCO2 should increase).
- Cases illustrated:
  - **Metabolic alkalosis with appropriate compensation:** HCO3− 30, PCO2 44, pH 7.46; expected ΔPCO2 ≈ 0.7 × 6 ≈ +4 → PCO2 ~44.
  - **High anion gap metabolic acidosis** with appropriate respiratory compensation in sepsis (AG 24; PCO2 within Winter’s range).
- Know that **renal tubular acidosis** is a cause of **normal anion gap metabolic acidosis**.

**4. Apply knowledge of diuretics and diuretic side effects to clinical scenarios.**

- Matching drug to indication and side effects:
  - **Thiazides (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide):** Treat hypertension; reduce **calcium oxalate stone** recurrence by increasing Ca2+ reabsorption.
  - **Loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide):** Cause **contraction alkalosis**, **hypokalemia**, and ↓Ca2+ reabsorption.
  - **Acetazolamide:** Causes **metabolic acidosis** (carbonic anhydrase inhibition).
  - **K+-sparing/MRAs (e.g., spironolactone, amiloride):** Risk of **hyperkalemia**.
- Site-of-action pearls (from nephron diagrams): loops in thick ascending limb; thiazides in DCT; K+-sparing at ENaC/MR; acetazolamide in PCT.

**5. Distinguish clinical scenarios of water disorders and sodium balance disorders.**

- **Water (tonicity) disorders:** Reflected by changes in plasma **[Na+]** and osmolality; governed primarily by **ADH**.
  - Example: Adding **NaCl without water** raises tonicity, expands **ECF**, and shrinks **ICF**; [Na+] increases.
- **Sodium balance (volume) disorders:** Reflected by changes in **ECF volume**; governed by **RAAS** and **ANP**.
  - Example: **Isotonic saline** expands **ECF** with no change in tonicity or ICF.
- Hormonal integration:
  - **AT II** enhances Na+ reabsorption at **NHE3** and increases **aldosterone**; **ANP** promotes natriuresis when atrial pressure is high; **ADH** regulates collecting duct water permeability.

**6. Understand renal autoregulation and how situations can affect autoregulation and GFR.**

- Mechanisms:
  - **Myogenic response** and **tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF)** maintain stable **RBF/GFR** across a range of blood pressures.
  - **AT II** preferentially increases **efferent** resistance to help maintain GFR during low MAP.
- Clinical modifier:
  - **NSAIDs** inhibit prostaglandin-mediated afferent dilation, leading to **afferent constriction** and reduced **glomerular capillary pressure** → ↓GFR (explains creatinine rise with NSAIDs).
- Be able to predict GFR/RBF changes with alterations in **afferent (AA)** and **efferent (EE)** arteriolar resistance.

**7. Apply concepts of kidney clearance to patient care.**

- Core formula: **Clearance (Cx) = (Ux × V) / Px**.
- Clinical applications:
  - If creatinine rises from **1.0 to 4.0 mg/dL**, and muscle mass is unchanged, GFR falls proportionally from **~100 to ~25 mL/min**.
  - High muscle mass can elevate plasma creatinine despite normal GFR; a **24-hour urine** can clarify:
    - Example: Urine creatinine 2,880 mg/24 h and plasma creatinine 2.0 mg/dL yields clearance ≈ **100 mL/min**.
- Key principles highlighted: use measured **urine excretion and plasma concentration** to estimate clearance; interpret creatinine in context of generation (muscle mass) and secretion.
