### Lecture 17: Glomerular Diseases Causing Nephrotic Syndrome

**1. Review the basic structure and function of the normal glomerulus.**

The glomerular filtration barrier has three key layers: 
- **Fenestrated endothelium**, 
- **Glomerular basement membrane (GBM)**, and 
- **Podocyte** foot processes connected by the **slit diaphragm**. 

The slit diaphragm is a specialized protein complex (e.g., **nephrin**, **podocin**, **α-actinin-4**) that provides size- and charge-selectivity, preventing plasma proteins from crossing into the urine. Normal podocyte foot processes are perpendicular to the GBM; disruption leads to filtration defects. Functionally, injury location within this barrier predicts syndrome:
- Podocyte/slit diaphragm injury → heavy protein loss → **nephrotic syndrome**.
- Endocapillary/GBM inflammatory injury → **hematuria** (dysmorphic RBCs, **RBC casts**) → **nephritic syndrome**.

**2. Describe the range of glomerular diseases, distinguishing nephrotic from nephritic disease.**

- **Nephrotic syndrome**: 
  - Diagnostic features: **proteinuria >3.5 g/day**, **hypoalbuminemia**, **edema**, **hyperlipidemia** (± lipiduria). 
  - Complications: **hypercoagulability** (e.g., renal vein thrombosis, VTE), **infections** (loss of immunoglobulins), risk of **progressive CKD/ESRD**.
  - Typical causes: **Minimal change disease (MCD)**, **FSGS**, **Membranous nephropathy**, and systemic causes like **diabetic nephropathy**.
- **Nephritic syndrome (glomerulonephritis, GN)**:
  - Features: **hematuria** (tea/cola-colored urine, RBC casts, dysmorphic RBCs), usually **subnephrotic proteinuria**, **hypertension**, **reduced GFR/AKI**, **oliguria**, edema.
  - Causes include infection-related GN, **anti-GBM**, **ANCA-associated** GN, and immune complex diseases.
- Mixed phenotypes exist (e.g., **MPGN**) and **SLE** can present with nephritic, nephrotic, or both.

**3. Describe the pathophysiology of proteinuria.**

Proteinuria arises from three main mechanisms:
- **Glomerular proteinuria** (most nephrotic etiologies): due to an abnormal **glomerular filter** with **podocyte foot process effacement**, causing increased filtration of **albumin**, **transferrin**, and even **IgG** (nonselective proteinuria in severe cases).
- **Tubular proteinuria**: impaired **proximal tubular reabsorption** of normally filtered proteins; typically <3 g/day and often accompanied by other proximal tubule defects (e.g., glucosuria, bicarbonaturia, aminoaciduria; seen in tubulointerstitial diseases or **Fanconi syndrome**).
- **Overload proteinuria**: increased circulating small, filterable proteins (e.g., **light chains** in plasma cell dyscrasias) overwhelm reabsorption; dipstick may be negative for albumin; can cause tubular toxicity and casts.

Quantification tools: **urinalysis dipstick**, **spot protein/creatinine or albumin/creatinine ratios**, and **24-hour urine protein**. >3.5 g/day of albumin strongly points to a glomerular origin. Early detection of albuminuria (microalbumin) is key in diabetes.

**4. Describe the basic immune mechanisms of glomerular injury.**

Glomerular injury often reflects **antibody–antigen interactions** forming **immune complexes (ICs)**:
- **In situ ICs**: antibodies bind intrinsic podocyte/GBM antigens (e.g., podocyte **PLA2R**, **THSD7A**, **NELL1**, rare **neutral endopeptidase** in congenital cases).
- **Planted antigens**: exogenous antigens (e.g., **hepatitis B** antigens, drugs) lodge in the GBM and become IC targets.
- **Circulating ICs**: form in blood and deposit in the glomerulus (e.g., **lupus**).
Complement activation can lead to **hypocomplementemia (low C3/C4)** in specific diseases. On **immunofluorescence (IF)**, patterns help differentiate diseases:
- **Linear** Ig/complement along GBM (e.g., anti-GBM disease).
- **Granular** deposits (e.g., **membranous nephropathy**, **lupus**).

**5. Identify different patterns of injury on light microscopy, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy.**

- **Light microscopy (LM)**: structural changes such as **diffusely thickened capillary loops** (membranous nephropathy), **segmental sclerosis/hyalinosis** (FSGS), **mesangial expansion** and nodularity (diabetes), or proliferation in GN. 
- **Immunofluorescence (IF)**: 
  - **Granular IgG/C3** along capillary walls in **membranous nephropathy**.
  - Patterns and intensity of Ig/complement deposition (granular vs linear; mesangial vs capillary wall) guide diagnosis.
- **Electron microscopy (EM)**:
  - **Diffuse podocyte foot process effacement** in **MCD** and **FSGS**.
  - **Subepithelial electron-dense deposits** with **GBM spikes** in **membranous nephropathy**.
  - Deposit location matters: **subepithelial**, **subendothelial**, **intramembranous**, or **mesangial**.
- Urine microscopy in nephrotic states may show **lipiduria** with **fat oval bodies** and **Maltese crosses**; nephritic states show **dysmorphic RBCs** and **RBC casts**.

**6. Describe the morphologic abnormalities in MCD, FSGS, membranous nephropathy, and diabetic nephropathy.**

- **Minimal Change Disease (MCD)**:
  - LM: **normal glomeruli**.
  - IF: **negative**.
  - EM: **diffuse podocyte foot process effacement**.
  - Clinical: most common nephrotic syndrome in children; can be secondary to **NSAIDs**, **HIV**, **lymphoma**; emerging evidence for anti-**nephrin** autoantibodies in some cases. Steroid-responsive.

- **Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS)**:
  - LM: **focal** and **segmental** glomerular **sclerosis** and **hyalinosis**.
  - IF: typically **negative**.
  - EM: **foot process effacement**.
  - Clinical: most common cause of adult nephrotic syndrome in the U.S. 
    - Primary (likely **autoimmune/circulating factor**).
    - Secondary/adaptive: **hyperfiltration** (low nephron mass, **obesity**), **sickle cell disease**, chronic **reflux**, **interferon therapy**, **HIV**, **heroin**, some **genetic** forms (notably **APOL1** variants). Secondary FSGS reflects a scarring response to chronic glomerular stress and may be non-nephrotic.

- **Membranous Nephropathy (MN)**:
  - LM: **diffusely thickened capillary loops**.
  - IF: **granular IgG and C3** along capillary walls.
  - EM: **subepithelial deposits** with **GBM spikes**.
  - Clinical: Primary MN is an **autoantibody-mediated** podocytopathy—70–80% with **anti-PLA2R**; others include **THSD7A** and **NELL1**. Secondary causes: **solid tumors** (bowel, breast, lung), **HBV** > HCV, **SLE**, **malaria**, **syphilis**, **NSAIDs/penicillamine**. Incidence increases with age; men > women. Serum **anti-PLA2R** and tissue PLA2R staining support diagnosis and monitoring.

- **Diabetic Nephropathy**:
  - Pathogenesis: **hyperglycemia** → **non-enzymatic glycation**, **mesangial expansion**, **GBM thickening**, increased permeability.
  - LM: mesangial expansion (diffuse and nodular), thickened GBM; arteriolar hyalinosis.
  - Clinical: leading cause of **ESRD** in the U.S.; early detection with albuminuria screening is key to prognosis.

These morphologic patterns map to clinical syndromes: podocyte injury causes heavy proteinuria (nephrotic), while inflammatory/endocapillary injury causes hematuria and reduced GFR (nephritic).
