### Lecture 19: Urine Diagnostic Testing

**1. Describe the steps involved in performing a complete urinalysis and urine microscopy.**

A complete urinalysis includes three sequential components:  
- **Gross examination:** Assess urine **color** (normally yellow from urochrome; darker when concentrated), **turbidity** (normally clear; cloudiness may suggest infection, crystals, or protein), and **odor** (slight ammonia is normal; foul odor suggests infection; “fruity” suggests DKA).  
- **Dipstick testing:** A rapid screen using reagent pads for key analytes (e.g., specific gravity, pH, leukocyte esterase, nitrite, blood, protein).  
- **Urine microscopy:** Centrifuge ~10 mL at ≥1500 rpm for ≥5 minutes, decant supernatant, place a drop of sediment on a slide and examine at low and high power (brightfield or phase contrast), including the coverslip edges where **casts** accumulate.

When to perform a UA: in patients with abnormal kidney function, suspected **nephritic/nephrotic syndromes**, chronic diseases affecting kidneys (e.g., diabetes, SLE), or suspected **UTI/pyelonephritis/nephrolithiasis**.  
Specimen collection: Prefer **midstream clean-catch** or catheter tubing; examine within **2 hours** or refrigerate and assess within **8 hours**.

**2. Outline the components of a urine dipstick and of urine microscopy.**

- Dipstick components and clinical use:  
  - **Specific gravity (SG 1.005–1.030):** Crude reflection of urine osmolality; higher SG with concentrated urine (e.g., dehydration, prerenal states).  
  - **pH (4.5–8):** Assesses renal acidification; in **metabolic acidosis**, appropriate response is urine pH < 5. Failure to acidify suggests **renal tubular acidosis**; alkaline urine may occur with **urease-producing infections** and struvite stones.  
  - **Leukocyte esterase (LE):** Marker of WBCs (pyuria); positive in UTI and in sterile pyuria (e.g., AIN, TB).  
  - **Nitrite:** Indicates bacteria with **nitrate reductase** (e.g., Enterobacteriaceae). A positive is specific for bacteriuria; a negative does not rule out UTI (low enzyme expression or short bladder dwell time).  
  - **Blood:** Detects **RBCs, hemoglobin, or myoglobin**; highly sensitive—must be confirmed by microscopy to distinguish hematuria from heme pigments.

- Microscopy evaluates elements not captured by dipstick:  
  - **Cells:** RBCs, WBCs, epithelial cells (squamous, transitional, renal tubular).  
  - **Casts:** Cylindrical structures of **Tamm–Horsfall protein (uromodulin)** embedding cells or debris (formed in distal tubules/collecting ducts).  
  - **Crystals:** Help with stone type and some metabolic conditions.

A structured approach to red urine differentiates:  
- Dipstick blood negative + no RBCs: pigments from **drugs/foods/dyes**.  
- Dipstick blood positive + no RBCs: **hemoglobinuria** (hemolysis) or **myoglobinuria** (rhabdomyolysis).  
- Dipstick blood positive + RBCs present: true **hematuria**.

**3. Describe the various methods used to detect and quantitate protein in the urine.**

- Detection:  
  - Dipstick detects primarily **albumin** and is **concentration dependent**; 1+/2+/3+ categories are unreliable. Dilute urine can under-read and concentrated urine can over-read. A positive dipstick requires **quantification**.

- Quantification:  
  - **24-hour urine collection:** Gold standard for total protein or albumin excretion, but cumbersome; check 24-h creatinine (men ~20–25 mg/kg/d; women ~15–20 mg/kg/d) to assess completeness.  
  - **Spot ratios (estimate g/day):**  
    - **UPCR (urine protein-to-creatinine ratio):** Total protein (mg/dL) / creatinine (mg/dL); a ratio of 1 ≈ 1 g/day.  
    - **UACR (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio):** Preferred for low-level albuminuria and early detection (e.g., diabetic nephropathy).  
  - Limitations: Spot ratios assume ~1 g/day creatinine excretion; they **underestimate** proteinuria in very muscular patients and **overestimate** it in frail/low muscle mass patients—consider confirming with a **24-hour collection**.

- Definitions:  
  - Albumin: **Normal <30 mg/day or UACR <30 mg/g**; **Moderately increased 30–300 mg/day (UACR 30–300 mg/g); Severely increased >300 mg/day (UACR >300 mg/g)**.  
  - Total protein: **Normal <150 mg/day or UPCR <150 mg/g; Moderately increased 150–500 mg/day; Severely increased >500 mg/day**.

- Types of proteinuria (helps interpret results):  
  - **Glomerular:** Increased filtration of albumin due to altered glomerular permeability; includes benign transient forms (orthostatic, exercise). **Nephrotic-range >3.5 g/day** implies glomerular disease.  
  - **Tubular:** Impaired proximal tubular reabsorption → low–molecular weight proteins (e.g., β2-microglobulin) predominate; magnitude usually lower than glomerular.  
  - **Overflow:** Overproduction (e.g., monoclonal light chains in multiple myeloma) overwhelms reabsorption; detected by specialized tests (e.g., electrophoresis), not by albumin-only dipsticks.

**4. Identify formed elements on urine microscopy (cells, casts) and discuss their clinical significance.**

- Cells:  
  - **RBCs:**  
    - **Isomorphic** RBCs resemble peripheral smear and suggest non-glomerular sources (e.g., stones, UTI, tumors).  
    - **Dysmorphic** RBCs, especially **acanthocytes** (blebbed forms), suggest **glomerular injury**.  
  - **WBCs:** Seen with **UTI** or **tubulointerstitial inflammation** (e.g., AIN).  
  - **Renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs):** Indicate **tubular injury** (e.g., ATN).

- Casts (uromodulin matrix; formed in tubules):  
  - **RBC casts:** Strongly suggest **acute glomerulonephritis** (nephritic processes).  
  - **WBC casts:** Indicate **inflammation**—seen in **GN, AIN, pyelonephritis**.  
  - **Hyaline casts:** Colorless; can be normal or seen with **volume depletion**, concentrated urine, or after exercise.  
  - **Granular casts (muddy brown):** Coarse, deeply pigmented; classic for **acute tubular necrosis (ATN)**.  
  - **Epithelial cell casts:** RTECs embedded in cast; seen in **ATN** and **AIN**.  
  - **Waxy casts:** Broad, waxy appearance; nonspecific, often in **chronic kidney disease**.  
  - **Fatty casts/oval fat bodies:** Lipid droplets/cholesterol; **Maltese cross** under polarized light; seen with heavy proteinuria in **nephrotic syndrome**.

**5. Interpret urinalysis and urine microscopy findings in the context of clinical vignettes.**

- Pattern recognition:  
  - **Nephritic syndrome (e.g., IgA nephropathy):** Hematuria with **RBC casts**, variable protein (often sub-nephrotic), sometimes elevated creatinine and hypertension; pathology may show **mesangial proliferation**.  
  - **Prerenal AKI:** Clinical hypovolemia, high **BUN/Cr ratio**, **FeNa < 1%**, **urine Na < 20**, high **specific gravity**; microscopy often shows **hyaline casts**.  
  - Distinguish from **ATN**, which features **muddy brown granular casts** and **RTEC casts**, with higher FeNa and less concentrated urine.  
  - Approach to “red urine”: Use dipstick-plus-microscopy to separate **hematuria** from **hemoglobinuria/myoglobinuria** and from **pigments/dyes**; in dipstick-positive but RBC-negative cases, evaluate for **hemolysis** (e.g., low haptoglobin, high LDH, positive Coombs depending on etiology) or **rhabdomyolysis** (elevated CPK).

Together, these steps allow you to integrate dipstick and microscopy with the clinical picture to localize disease (glomerular vs tubular vs extrarenal), identify complications (e.g., infection, stones), and guide further testing and management.
