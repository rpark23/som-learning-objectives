### Lecture 13: Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) Part 1

**1. Define acute kidney injury.**

AKI is a sudden loss of renal function over hours to days, detected by a decline in **GFR** and manifested clinically by rising **serum creatinine**, **urea (BUN)**, and often decreased **urine output**. The widely used **KDIGO 2012** definition includes any of the following:
- Increase in **SCr ≥0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours**, or
- Increase in **SCr ≥1.5× baseline within 7 days**, or
- **Urine volume <0.5 mL/kg/h for ≥6 hours**.

Because true GFR is not directly measurable, creatinine is used to estimate GFR (eGFR). Even a small creatinine rise (e.g., 0.3 mg/dL) can reflect a large GFR fall when baseline creatinine is low. Clinically, AKI leads to accumulation of metabolic wastes and can cause **metabolic acidosis**, **electrolyte disturbances**, and **volume overload**. Risk is increased with **older age**, **diabetes**, **cardiovascular disease**, and **CKD**. AKI carries high morbidity and mortality and can progress to or worsen **CKD**. Beyond creatinine, early injury biomarkers (e.g., **NGAL**, **KIM-1**, **IL-18**) are under study.

**2. Classify the causes of acute kidney injury (prerenal, intrinsic, postrenal).**

Basic renal anatomy underpins AKI classification:
- **Prerenal AKI:** Decreased renal perfusion and effective arterial blood volume with intact tubules (e.g., hypovolemia, heart failure, sepsis, cirrhosis, renal artery stenosis).
- **Intrinsic renal AKI:** Injury within the kidney parenchyma—**tubules** (e.g., ATN), **interstitium** (TIN), **glomeruli** (GN), or **vessels** (vasculitis, thrombotic microangiopathy).
- **Postrenal AKI:** **Obstruction** to urinary outflow from the renal pelvis to urethra.

Key principle: a sudden GFR reduction can result from reduced **perfusion**, **parenchymal injury**, or **urinary obstruction**. Most inpatient AKI is due to **prerenal AKI** and **intrinsic AKI** from ischemia or nephrotoxins.

**3. Describe the pathophysiological processes that contribute to prerenal AKI and ischemic ATN.**

- Prerenal AKI: functional, tubules intact
  - **Autoregulation** normally maintains RBF and GFR over MAP ~80–180 mmHg via:
    - **Angiotensin II** (constricts arterioles, especially the **efferent**), helping preserve glomerular capillary pressure.
    - **Prostaglandins** and **nitric oxide** (vasodilate the **afferent**), countering excessive vasoconstriction.
    - **Catecholamines** (α-adrenergic–mediated afferent vasoconstriction) in severe low-flow states.
  - When perfusion pressure falls below autoregulatory capacity or when modulators are blocked, **RBF and GFR fall** → prerenal AKI.
    - Drugs that impair autoregulation: **NSAIDs** (↓PG → afferent constriction), **ACEi/ARB** (↓efferent tone), **calcineurin inhibitors** (↑renal vasoconstriction).
  - The **medulla** is relatively hypoxic at baseline (outer medullary PCT and TAL have high O2 demand), making it vulnerable in hypoperfusion.
  - Causes include: **ECF volume depletion** (hemorrhage, vomiting/diarrhea, diuresis), **low cardiac output** (MI, tamponade), **low SVR** (sepsis, liver failure), and **increased renal vascular resistance** (renal artery stenosis, drugs).
  - Tubular response: intact tubules avidly reabsorb **Na+ and water** (mediated by SNS, **RAAS**, **ADH**) → **concentrated urine**, **low urine Na+**, **low FeNa**, and **BUN rises more than creatinine** due to increased urea reabsorption.

- Ischemic ATN: structural injury, continuum from prerenal hypoperfusion
  - Hemodynamic/vascular:
    - Loss of normal **autoregulation**; paradoxical **renal vasoconstriction** (AII, endothelin, adenosine, thromboxanes) and heightened **TGF** from increased distal NaCl delivery → **afferent constriction**, lower glomerular pressure, ↓GFR.
    - **Endothelial injury**: leukocyte adhesion and **vascular congestion** in the outer medulla → worsened hypoxia, increased permeability, interstitial edema.
  - Epithelial injury:
    - Loss of **polarity** (mislocalization of **Na+/K+-ATPase**), impaired vectorial transport.
    - **Integrin** redistribution → loss of adhesion → **cell detachment**, **necrosis**, **apoptosis**.
    - **Back-leak** of filtrate through disrupted tight junctions and **intratubular obstruction** by granular casts → increased tubular pressure and measured GFR decline.
  - Inflammation:
    - Infiltration by **neutrophils/mononuclear cells** and **ROS**-mediated injury amplifies damage.
  - Phases and repair:
    - Progression through **initiation**, **extension**, **maintenance**, then **repair**. Surviving cells **dedifferentiate**, **migrate**, **proliferate**, and **redifferentiate**; rising urine output often precedes GFR recovery.

**4. Understand how prerenal AKI and ischemic ATN affect certain lab parameters.**

- **BUN/Creatinine ratio:**
  - Prerenal: **>20:1** due to increased **proximal urea reabsorption** with water/Na+ reabsorption (watch for confounders: GI bleed, high-protein diet, steroids).
  - ATN: often **10–15:1** (less urea reabsorption).
- **Urine sodium and FeNa:**
  - Prerenal: **urine Na+ <20 mEq/L**; **FeNa <1%** (intact avid Na+ reabsorption).
  - ATN: **urine Na+ >40 mEq/L**; **FeNa >2%** (impaired reabsorption). Note overlap and clinical context dependence.
- **Urine osmolality:**
  - Prerenal: **>500 mOsm/kg** (intact concentrating ability with high **ADH**).
  - ATN: typically **~300–350 mOsm/kg** (impaired medullary concentrating mechanism).
- **Urinalysis:**
  - Prerenal: may show **hyaline casts**.
  - ATN: **brown granular (“muddy brown”) casts**, **renal epithelial cells**.
- These tests support but do not replace a clinical diagnosis; overlap can occur.

**5. Diagnose prerenal AKI, ischemic ATN, and distinguish between them in clinical scenarios.**

- Clinical approach:
  - **History:** assess for decreased **effective circulating volume** (bleeding, GI loss, diuretics), edematous states (**heart failure**, **cirrhosis**), **sepsis**, and **nephrotoxic or hemodynamically active drugs** (**NSAIDs**, **ACEi/ARB**, **CNIs**).
  - **Exam:** vitals, volume status (**JVD**, edema, ascites, skin turgor), signs of pulmonary edema or shock.
  - **Labs/urine:** use **BUN/Cr**, **urine Na+**, **FeNa**, **Uosm**, and **urinalysis** as corroborating data.
- Distinguishing features:
  - **Prerenal AKI:** history of hypoperfusion; tubules intact; concentrated urine, **low UNa/low FeNa**, often **BUN/Cr >20**, tends to respond promptly to restoring perfusion (fluids, hemodynamic optimization, stopping offending drugs).
  - **Ischemic ATN:** prolonged/severe hypoperfusion or toxin exposure; structural tubular injury; **muddy brown casts**, **higher UNa/FeNa**, impaired concentration; does not rapidly correct with fluids.
- Management principles:
  - **Prerenal:** restore **renal perfusion** (e.g., isotonic fluids for true volume depletion, treat cardiac dysfunction), remove precipitating drugs.
  - **Ischemic ATN:** mainly **supportive care** for AKI complications; prevent further injury and anticipate high-risk settings. Recognize that prerenal AKI and ATN form a **continuum** and constitute most inpatient AKI.
  - Be aware of **organ cross-talk** in AKI (proinflammatory/apoptotic signaling affecting lung, heart, brain, liver), contributing to poor outcomes in critical illness.
