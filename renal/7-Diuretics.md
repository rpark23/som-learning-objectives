### Lecture 7: Renal Sodium Handling, Diuretics and Diet

**1. Describe how sodium is handled along the nephron and how this is altered in diseased states.**

*   **Normal Sodium Handling:**
    *   The kidneys filter a massive amount of sodium each day (~25,000 mEq), but reabsorb over 99% of it to maintain sodium balance. This reabsorption occurs along the entire nephron:
        *   **Proximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT):** Reabsorbs 60-70% of the filtered sodium.
        *   **Thick Ascending Limb (TAL) of Loop of Henle:** Reabsorbs 20-30%.
        *   **Distal Convoluted Tubule (DCT):** Reabsorbs 5-7%.
        *   **Collecting Duct:** Reabsorbs the final 2-3%, which is the primary site of regulation.

*   **Sodium Handling in Diseased States:**
    *   In conditions like **congestive heart failure (CHF), cirrhosis, and nephrotic syndrome**, the body perceives a **decreased effective arterial blood volume (EABV)**, even if the total body fluid is normal or high. This perceived underfilling triggers the **Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS)** and the sympathetic nervous system.
    *   This leads to a compensatory increase in sodium reabsorption at multiple sites along the nephron, causing **sodium retention**, ECF volume expansion, and clinical signs of volume overload like edema and ascites.
    *   In **Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)**, as nephrons are lost, the remaining nephrons must excrete a larger fraction of their filtered sodium to maintain balance. However, this compensatory mechanism eventually fails, leading to sodium retention and hypertension.

**2. Categorize the 4 major classes of diuretics (based on the tubular segment where sodium reabsorption is blocked) and their mechanisms of action.**

Diuretics are drugs that increase urine output, primarily by promoting the excretion of sodium (natriuresis). They are classified by their primary site of action in the nephron:

1.  **Proximal Tubule Diuretics (e.g., Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors like Acetazolamide):**
    *   **Mechanism:** Inhibit carbonic anhydrase, an enzyme crucial for the reabsorption of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) in the PCT. They are relatively weak diuretics.

2.  **Loop Diuretics (e.g., Furosemide, Bumetanide):**
    *   **Mechanism:** Act on the **Thick Ascending Limb (TAL)**. They are the most powerful class of diuretics. They block the **Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter (NKCC2)**, inhibiting the reabsorption of ~30% of the filtered sodium load.

3.  **Thiazide-type Diuretics (e.g., Hydrochlorothiazide, Chlorthalidone):**
    *   **Mechanism:** Act on the **Distal Convoluted Tubule (DCT)**. They block the **Na+-Cl- cotransporter (NCC)**, inhibiting the reabsorption of ~7% of the filtered sodium.

4.  **Potassium-sparing Diuretics:**
    *   **Mechanism:** Act on the **Collecting Duct**. There are two subclasses:
        *   **Epithelial Na Channel (ENaC) Blockers (e.g., Amiloride, Triamterene):** Directly block the ENaC channel, preventing sodium reabsorption.
        *   **Aldosterone Antagonists (e.g., Spironolactone, Eplerenone):** Block the action of aldosterone, which normally promotes sodium reabsorption through ENaC.

**3. Understand the main side effects of diuretics based on mechanism of action.**

The side effects are direct consequences of their actions on tubular transport:

*   **Loop Diuretics (Furosemide):**
    *   **Hypokalemia & Metabolic Alkalosis:** By delivering a large amount of sodium to the collecting duct, they promote the exchange of Na+ for K+ and H+, leading to potassium and acid wasting.
    *   **Hypocalcemia & Hypomagnesemia:** Blocking the NKCC2 transporter disrupts the lumen-positive potential in the TAL, which is necessary for the paracellular reabsorption of calcium and magnesium.

*   **Thiazide Diuretics (Hydrochlorothiazide):**
    *   **Hypokalemia & Metabolic Alkalosis:** Similar mechanism to loop diuretics, though typically less severe.
    *   **Hyponatremia:** A key side effect. Thiazides impair the kidney's ability to create dilute urine without affecting its ability to concentrate it, leading to a risk of water retention.
    *   **Hypercalcemia:** Unlike loop diuretics, thiazides *increase* calcium reabsorption in the DCT.

*   **Potassium-sparing Diuretics (Spironolactone, Amiloride):**
    *   **Hyperkalemia:** This is their defining side effect. By blocking either ENaC or the action of aldosterone, they inhibit the principal mechanism for potassium secretion in the collecting duct.
    *   **Metabolic Acidosis:** By inhibiting H+ secretion in the collecting duct, they can cause a mild acidosis.

**4. Understand how to utilize diuretics.**

*   **Clinical Scenarios:** Diuretics are primarily used to manage states of volume overload.
    *   **Heart Failure, Cirrhosis, Nephrotic Syndrome:** **Loop diuretics** are the mainstay of therapy for managing the significant edema and volume overload seen in these conditions.
    *   **Hypertension:** **Thiazide diuretics** are often a first-line therapy due to their long duration of action and effectiveness in lowering blood pressure.
    *   **Resistant Hypertension/Ascites:** **Potassium-sparing diuretics** (especially aldosterone antagonists) are key adjunctive therapies, often used in combination with loop or thiazide diuretics.

*   **Diuretic Braking:** When diuretics are used long-term, the body adapts by increasing sodium reabsorption in downstream nephron segments (e.g., hypertrophy of the DCT in response to chronic loop diuretic use). This can lead to diuretic resistance. This is often managed by using combination therapy (e.g., a loop diuretic + a thiazide diuretic) to achieve a sequential nephron blockade.

**5. Describe the general principles of a low sodium diet.**

*   **Definition:** A low sodium diet is a dietary pattern where total sodium intake is restricted. Standard recommendations are typically **< 2,300 mg/day**. More stringent targets of **< 2,000 mg/day or < 1,500 mg/day** are often recommended for individuals with hypertension, heart failure, or CKD.
*   **Context:** The average American diet contains ~3,400 mg of sodium per day, which is far from a low sodium diet. High sodium intake directly promotes ECF volume expansion and can exacerbate conditions like hypertension and edema.
*   **Equivalency:** 1 teaspoon of table salt contains approximately 2,300 mg of sodium.
