# Kidney Stones Learning Objectives

## Understand the burden of kidney stone disease
*   **Epidemiology**: Kidney stones are common, with 8-12% of people experiencing a symptom of a kidney stone in their lifetime. The prevalence is rising, and they are highly recurrent, with 50% of people developing a recurrent stone within 5 years.
*   **Clinical Presentation**: Symptoms can vary. Stones can be asymptomatic when in the kidney, but cause significant pain (renal colic) when they drop into the ureter. Other symptoms include hematuria (blood in the urine), dysuria (pain with urination), and urgency.
*   **Complications**: Complications include obstruction of the urinary tract, which can occur with or without acute renal failure, and systemic infection (urosepsis).

## Understand how kidney stones form
*   **Pathophysiology**: The formation of kidney stones begins with supersaturated urine, which leads to the formation of crystals.
*   **Calcium Oxalate Stones**: The most common type of stone forms on a nidus called a Randall's plaque. This plaque is an initial calcium phosphate concretion near the renal papilla's epithelium, which erodes through the urothelium and forms a surface for calcium oxalate deposition.

## Describe the common types of kidney stones and risk factors for each type of kidney stone
*   **Calcium Oxalate**: These are the most common type of stone, accounting for about 80% of stones.
    *   **Microscopy**: Monohydrate crystals appear as dumbbells, and dihydrate crystals appear as envelopes.
    *   **Risk Factors**: Low urine volume, hypercalciuria, hyperoxaluria, hypocitraturia, and hyperuricosuria.
*   **Calcium Phosphate**: These make up 5-14% of stones.
    *   **Microscopy**: Wedge-shaped prisms.
    *   **Risk Factors**: More common in women, urine pH > 6.3, and medications like topiramate and acetazolamide. Other risk factors include low urine volume, alkaline pH, hypercalciuria, and hyperphosphaturia.
*   **Uric Acid**: These account for 3-10% of all stones and are associated with metabolic syndrome, Type 2 Diabetes, and obesity.
    *   **Microscopy**: Rounded rhomboids or needle-shapes.
    *   **Risk Factors**: Low urine volume, low urine pH (most important), and rarely, hyperuricosuria.
*   **Struvite**: These make up 10-12% of stones and are also known as infection stones.
    *   **Microscopy**: Rectangular prisms or "coffin-lids".
    *   **Risk Factors**: More common in women and associated with chronic urinary tract infections with urease-producing bacteria like *Proteus mirabilis*.
*   **Cystine**: These are rare, accounting for less than 2% of all stones.
    *   **Microscopy**: Hexagons.
    *   **Cause**: A homozygous recessive gene for cystine transport, leading to cystinuria.

## Understand basic medical and surgical management for kidney stones
*   **Diagnosis**: The most sensitive and specific imaging is a non-contrast CT scan. Ultrasound can also be used.
*   **Medical Management**:
    *   **24-hour urine testing**: This is done to identify risk factors and guide treatment.
    *   **Thiazide diuretics**: Used to lower calcium excretion in the urine.
    *   **Alkali therapy (e.g., potassium citrate)**: Used in calcium oxalate stones to bind calcium and in uric acid stones to raise urine pH and dissolve the stones.
    *   **Allopurinol**: A xanthine oxidase inhibitor used to treat hyperuricosuric calcium stone formers.
*   **Surgical Management**: The need for and timing of surgery depends on the stone size and symptoms.
    *   **Extracorporeal Shockwave Lithotripsy (ESWL)**: Uses shock waves to break stones into smaller fragments. It is offered for stones that are visible on KUB.
    *   **Ureteroscopy (URS)**: Involves passing a small scope into the ureter to remove or fragment stones. It is preferred over ESWL for distal stones and can be used for kidney stones < 2cm.
    *   **Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy (PCNL)**: The most invasive procedure, performed for large stones (>2cm) or a large stone burden. It involves creating a tract from the flank into the kidney to remove the stones.
