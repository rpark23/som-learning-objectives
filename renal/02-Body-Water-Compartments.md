### Lecture 2: Body Fluid Compartments

**1. List the different body fluid compartments.**

The body's total body water (TBW) is divided into two major compartments:

*   **Intracellular Fluid (ICF):** This is the fluid located **inside** all the body's cells. It makes up the majority of the body's water.
*   **Extracellular Fluid (ECF):** This is the fluid located **outside** the cells. The ECF is further subdivided into two main spaces:
    *   **Interstitial Fluid:** The fluid that directly bathes the cells.
    *   **Intravascular Fluid (Plasma):** The non-cellular, fluid component of blood.

**2. Know the distribution of total body water in body fluid compartments.**

The "60-40-20 Rule" is a useful approximation for a standard 70 kg person:

*   **Total Body Water (TBW):** Makes up about **60%** of total body weight.
*   **Intracellular Fluid (ICF):** Accounts for **2/3** of the TBW (or 40% of total body weight).
*   **Extracellular Fluid (ECF):** Accounts for **1/3** of the TBW (or 20% of total body weight).

Furthermore, the ECF is distributed as follows:

*   **Interstitial Fluid:** Accounts for **3/4** of the ECF.
*   **Plasma (Intravascular Fluid):** Accounts for **1/4** of the ECF.

**3. Understand what determines body water distribution.**

The distribution of water between the body fluid compartments is determined by **osmotic pressure**. Water moves freely across most cell membranes and capillary walls to equalize osmotic forces.

*   **Key Principle:** Water follows solutes. The distribution of water is ultimately determined by the distribution of solutes that are restricted to certain compartments (known as **effective osmoles**).
*   **ICF vs. ECF:** The cell membrane separates these two compartments. The **Na+/K+ ATPase pump** actively maintains a high concentration of **potassium (K+)** inside the cells and a high concentration of **sodium (Na+)** outside the cells. Because these ions are largely restricted to their respective compartments, they are the primary determinants of osmotic pressure across the cell membrane.
    *   **Potassium** is the main solute that holds water in the **ICF**.
    *   **Sodium** is the main solute that holds water in the **ECF**.
*   **Interstitial vs. Plasma:** The capillary wall separates these two ECF sub-compartments. The main difference is the high concentration of **protein (especially albumin)** in the plasma. This protein creates oncotic pressure, which holds water within the intravascular space.

**4. Understand how addition of water and sodium affects the ICF and the ECF qualitatively and quantitatively.**

*   **Tonicity:** The key concept is tonicity, which refers to the effect a solution has on cell volume. It is determined by the concentration of *impermeable* solutes.
    *   **Isotonic Solution (e.g., 0.9% Normal Saline):** This solution has the same effective osmolarity as the body's fluids. Because it is primarily a sodium solution and sodium is restricted to the ECF, an isotonic fluid will **expand the ECF volume only**, with no change in ICF volume and no change in overall osmolarity.
    *   **Hypotonic Solution (e.g., Free Water, 5% Dextrose in Water after the dextrose is metabolized):** This solution has a lower effective osmolarity than the body's fluids. When administered, it lowers the osmolarity of the ECF. To restore osmotic equilibrium, water will move from the ECF **into the ICF**. The result is an **expansion of both the ECF and ICF** and a **decrease in the overall osmolarity** of all compartments.
    *   **Hypertonic Solution (e.g., 3% Saline):** This solution has a higher effective osmolarity than the body's fluids. When administered, it increases the osmolarity of the ECF. To restore osmotic equilibrium, water will move **out of the ICF** and into the ECF. The result is a **contraction (shrinking) of the ICF**, an **expansion of the ECF**, and an **increase in the overall osmolarity** of all compartments.

**5. Apply knowledge of body fluid compartments to clinical decisions regarding fluid administration.**

Understanding these principles is critical for making clinical decisions about IV fluid therapy:

*   **To replete intravascular volume in a patient with volume depletion (e.g., from hemorrhage or dehydration):** The goal is to expand the ECF. An **isotonic fluid** like normal saline is the appropriate choice because it will stay in the extracellular space.

*   **To treat hypernatremia (a state of water deficit):** The patient needs free water to lower their plasma sodium concentration and osmolarity. A **hypotonic fluid** like 5% Dextrose in Water (D5W) is used. The dextrose is quickly metabolized, leaving behind free water that distributes across all body compartments, lowering the overall osmolarity.

*   **To treat severe, symptomatic hyponatremia:** In this case, the goal is to raise the plasma sodium concentration. A **hypertonic fluid** like 3% saline is carefully administered to draw water out of the ICF and into the ECF, thereby increasing the sodium concentration.
