### Lecture 4: Regulation of Sodium Balance

**1. Describe conceptually the fractional excretion of sodium.**

*   **Concept:** The Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FeNa) represents the percentage of sodium that is filtered by the glomerulus and is ultimately excreted in the urine. It is a measure of how much of the filtered sodium the kidney tubules "decide" not to reabsorb.

*   **Formula:** FeNa = (Amount of Na+ Excreted) / (Amount of Na+ Filtered)

*   **Significance:** In a healthy state, the kidneys are extremely efficient at reabsorbing sodium to maintain body fluid volume. Therefore, the FeNa is typically very low, **less than 1%**. This demonstrates that while a massive amount of sodium is filtered each day, over 99% of it is reabsorbed. Small changes in this fractional excretion can lead to very large changes in total body sodium and ECF volume.

**2. Describe the handling of sodium by different nephron segments.**

Sodium reabsorption is a two-step process involving movement from the tubular lumen into the cell (apical membrane) and then from the cell into the blood (basolateral membrane). The Na+/K+-ATPase pump on the basolateral membrane is the primary engine for this entire process. Reabsorption occurs along the entire nephron, but the mechanism and percentage differ by segment:

*   **Proximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT):**
    *   **Amount:** Reabsorbs the bulk of the filtered sodium (**~60%**).
    *   **Mechanism:** Sodium is reabsorbed via cotransport with other solutes like glucose (SGLT2), amino acids, and phosphate, and via the Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE3), which is also crucial for bicarbonate reabsorption.

*   **Thick Ascending Limb (TAL) of the Loop of Henle:**
    *   **Amount:** Reabsorbs a significant portion of sodium (**~30%**).
    *   **Mechanism:** Sodium enters the cell via the **Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter (NKCC2)**. This segment is impermeable to water, so reabsorbing solute without water makes the tubular fluid dilute. This is a key site for paracellular reabsorption of Ca++ and Mg++.
    *   **Diuretic Target:** Loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide) block the NKCC2 transporter.

*   **Distal Convoluted Tubule (DCT):**
    *   **Amount:** Reabsorbs a smaller fraction of sodium (**~7%**).
    *   **Mechanism:** Sodium is reabsorbed via the **Na+-Cl- cotransporter (NCC)**. This segment is also relatively impermeable to water.
    *   **Diuretic Target:** Thiazide diuretics block the NCC transporter.

*   **Collecting Duct:**
    *   **Amount:** Reabsorbs the final **2-3%** of filtered sodium.
    *   **Mechanism:** Sodium is reabsorbed through the **Epithelial Sodium Channel (ENaC)** in the principal cells. This is the primary site for the fine-tuning and final regulation of sodium excretion.
    *   **Regulation:** This process is tightly regulated by hormones, primarily **aldosterone**, which increases Na+ reabsorption by upregulating ENaC.

**3. Recognize that ECF sodium content (not concentration) = ECF Volume.**

This is a critical concept in renal physiology.

*   **Sodium (Na+)** is the principal solute in the Extracellular Fluid (ECF) and is largely restricted to this compartment.
*   Because water follows solutes to maintain osmotic equilibrium, the **total amount (content) of sodium** in the body determines the **volume of the ECF**.
*   **Volume Disorder:** A state of abnormal total body sodium content. Too much sodium leads to volume overload (ECF expansion, e.g., edema), while too little sodium leads to volume depletion (ECF contraction).
*   **Tonicity Disorder:** This is different. It refers to the **concentration** of sodium ([Na+]), which is a ratio of salt to water. An abnormal [Na+] reflects a disorder of **water balance**, not sodium balance.

**4. Understand the volume sensors and effector mechanisms that regulate sodium excretion by the kidney to maintain ECF Volume.**

The body does not directly sense volume. Instead, it senses **effective circulating volume** or tissue perfusion via pressure receptors (baroreceptors).

*   **Volume Sensors (Baroreceptors):**
    *   **Location:** Aortic arch, carotid sinus, cardiac atria, and, most importantly for the kidney, the **afferent arteriole** of the glomerulus (part of the juxtaglomerular apparatus).

*   **Effector Mechanisms (activated in response to LOW volume/pressure):**
    When the body senses low volume, it activates several pathways to tell the kidney to retain sodium and water:
    1.  **Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS):** This is the most important effector system. Low pressure in the afferent arteriole triggers the release of **renin** from the juxtaglomerular cells. Renin initiates a cascade that produces **Angiotensin II** and **Aldosterone**.
        *   **Angiotensin II:** Increases sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule and constricts the efferent arteriole.
        *   **Aldosterone:** Acts on the collecting duct to increase sodium reabsorption via the ENaC channel.
    2.  **Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS):** Activated by baroreceptors, the SNS directly increases sodium reabsorption in the tubules and also stimulates renin release.
    3.  **Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH):** While primarily involved in water balance, ADH is also released in response to very low volume states and promotes water retention.

*   **Counter-Regulatory Mechanism (in response to HIGH volume):**
    *   **Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP):** Released from the cardiac atria in response to stretch (high volume). ANP promotes sodium excretion (natriuresis) by inhibiting RAAS and directly inhibiting sodium reabsorption in the collecting duct.

*   **Tubuloglomerular Feedback (TGF):** This is a local feedback mechanism where the **macula densa** (a group of specialized cells in the DCT) senses the amount of NaCl flowing past it. This information is used to regulate the GFR of its own nephron. If flow/NaCl delivery is too high, it signals the afferent arteriole to constrict, reducing GFR. If flow is too low, it signals the afferent arteriole to dilate, increasing GFR. This helps keep the filtration rate relatively stable.
