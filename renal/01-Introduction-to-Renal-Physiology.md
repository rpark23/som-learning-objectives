### Lecture 1: Introduction to Renal Physiology

**1. List the key anatomical parts of the kidney.**

*   **Poles:** Superior (upper) and Inferior (lower) poles.
*   **Borders:** Lateral and Medial borders.
*   **Hilum:** The notch on the medial border where the renal artery, renal vein, and ureter enter and exit the kidney.
*   **Capsule:** A fibrous outer covering of the kidney.
*   **Cortex:** The outer region of the kidney. It contains the glomeruli, proximal and distal convoluted tubules, and cortical collecting ducts.
*   **Medulla:** The inner region of the kidney, which is organized into several cone-shaped masses called **renal pyramids**. The medulla contains the loop of Henle and the medullary portions of the collecting ducts.
*   **Renal Pelvis:** A funnel-shaped structure that receives urine from the major calyces and is continuous with the ureter.

**2. Name the parts of the nephron.**

The nephron is the functional unit of the kidney. Its main parts are:

*   **Glomerulus and Bowman's Capsule:** Together, these form the renal corpuscle. The glomerulus is a tuft of capillaries where filtration occurs, and Bowman's capsule is the structure that surrounds the glomerulus and collects the filtrate.
*   **Tubule:** A long, complex tube that processes the filtrate into urine. It consists of the following segments in order:
    1.  **Proximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT)**
    2.  **Loop of Henle (LH):**
        *   Thin Descending Limb
        *   Thin Ascending Limb
        *   Thick Ascending Limb (TAL)
    3.  **Distal Convoluted Tubule (DCT)**
    4.  **Collecting Duct System**

**3. List the main functions of the kidney.**

The kidneys have several vital functions:

1.  **Elimination of Metabolic Waste Products:** The primary role is to filter the blood and excrete waste products of metabolism, such as urea (from protein breakdown), creatinine (from muscle), and uric acid (from nucleic acids).
2.  **Regulation of Body Fluid Volume:** The kidneys control the body's water balance by adjusting the volume of urine produced, which is critical for maintaining blood pressure.
3.  **Regulation of Electrolyte and Acid-Base Balance:** They precisely regulate the composition of the blood by controlling the excretion and reabsorption of electrolytes (like sodium, potassium, and calcium) and by maintaining acid-base homeostasis.
4.  **Hormone Production:** The kidneys are an endocrine organ, producing hormones such as:
    *   **Erythropoietin (EPO):** Stimulates the bone marrow to produce red blood cells.
    *   **Active Vitamin D (Calcitriol):** Essential for calcium absorption from the gut.

**4. Know the key functions of the glomerulus and the tubule.**

*   **Glomerulus ("The Filter"):**
    *   **Function:** The glomerulus acts as a high-pressure filter. It processes about 180 liters of plasma per day, allowing water and small solutes to pass from the blood into Bowman's space while retaining larger molecules like proteins (e.g., albumin) and blood cells. This initial fluid is called the glomerular filtrate.
    *   **Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR):** This is the total volume of fluid filtered by all the glomeruli in the kidneys per unit of time. It is the key measure of overall kidney function.

*   **Tubule ("The Processor"):**
    *   **Function:** The tubule's job is to process the massive volume of filtrate produced by the glomerulus to create the final urine. This involves three main processes:
        1.  **Reabsorption:** The vast majority of the filtered water and essential solutes (like glucose, amino acids, and most electrolytes) are reabsorbed from the tubule back into the blood. The Proximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT) is responsible for the bulk of this reabsorption.
        2.  **Secretion:** The tubule actively secretes additional waste products, toxins, and drugs from the blood into the tubular fluid for excretion.
        3.  **Fine-Tuning:** Under the influence of hormones (like aldosterone and ADH), the later parts of the tubule (especially the DCT and collecting ducts) perform fine-tuning of electrolyte and water balance to meet the body's needs.

**5. Understand the key principles of kidney physiology.**

There are several fundamental concepts that govern how the kidneys function:

*   **Balance and Steady State:** In a healthy state, "what goes in must come out." The kidneys maintain homeostasis by ensuring that the excretion of water and solutes precisely matches the intake and metabolic production, keeping the internal environment stable.

*   **Volume and Blood Pressure Trump Everything:** The maintenance of adequate circulating volume and blood pressure is the kidney's top priority. If faced with a choice, the kidney will sacrifice other functions (like perfect electrolyte balance) to preserve perfusion.

*   **Urine Composition Mimics the Body's Needs:** In a healthy state, the composition of urine reflects the body's efforts to maintain balance. For example, if the body has excess potassium, the urine will have a high potassium concentration as the kidneys work to excrete it. A discrepancy between the body's needs and the urine composition often signals a renal disorder.
