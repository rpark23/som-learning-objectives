### Lecture 10: Potassium Balance

**1. Recognize the physiological importance of plasma potassium (K+) concentration.**

The concentration of potassium (K+) in the plasma is one of the most tightly regulated variables in the body, normally maintained within a narrow range of 3.6 to 5.1 mEq/L. This is critically important because the steep concentration gradient of K+ between the intracellular fluid (ICF, ~140 mEq/L) and the extracellular fluid (ECF, ~4 mEq/L) is the primary determinant of the **resting membrane potential** of excitable cells. Deviations from the normal plasma K+ range (hypokalemia or hyperkalemia) can have severe, potentially lethal effects on neuromuscular and cardiac function, leading to muscle weakness, paralysis, and life-threatening arrhythmias.

**2. Describe the distribution of potassium across fluid compartments.**

*   **Intracellular vs. Extracellular:** Potassium is the most abundant cation in the body, but its distribution is highly compartmentalized. Approximately **98%** of the body's total potassium is located **inside the cells (in the ICF)**. Only about **2%** is found **outside the cells (in the ECF)**.
*   **Maintenance:** This steep gradient is actively maintained by the **Na+/K+-ATPase pump**, which is present on all cell membranes and continuously pumps Na+ out of cells and K+ into cells.

**3. Describe the mechanism of potassium uptake into cells and the responses to diet, exercise and acid-base disturbances.**

Maintaining potassium balance involves two processes: internal balance (shifting K+ between the ECF and ICF) and external balance (matching intake with excretion).

*   **Internal Balance (Redistribution):** This is the body's rapid response to prevent dangerous spikes in plasma K+ after an acute load.
    *   **Diet (K+ Load):** After a potassium-rich meal, the absorbed K+ enters the ECF. To prevent hyperkalemia, this K+ is rapidly shifted into cells (primarily liver and muscle). This uptake is stimulated by two key physiological regulators:
        1.  **Insulin:** The post-meal release of insulin stimulates the Na+/K+-ATPase pump, driving K+ into cells.
        2.  **Epinephrine (via Î²2-adrenergic receptors):** Catecholamines also stimulate the Na+/K+-ATPase pump, promoting cellular K+ uptake.
    *   **Exercise:** During vigorous exercise, K+ leaks out of muscle cells. The exercise-induced release of epinephrine helps to promote the re-uptake of this leaked K+ back into the cells.
    *   **Acid-Base Disturbances:**
        *   **Acidosis:** An excess of H+ in the ECF causes H+ to move into cells for buffering. To maintain electroneutrality, K+ moves out of the cells into the ECF, which can cause **hyperkalemia**.
        *   **Alkalosis:** A deficit of H+ in the ECF causes H+ to move out of cells. To maintain electroneutrality, K+ moves into the cells from the ECF, which can cause **hypokalemia**.

**4. Draw a model of tubular potassium transport pathways with a focus on the collecting tubule.**

While K+ is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule and loop of Henle, the final amount of K+ in the urine is determined by secretion in the distal nephron, primarily in the **principal cells** of the collecting tubule.

*   **Model of K+ Secretion in the Principal Cell:**
    1.  **Basolateral Uptake:** The **Na+/K+-ATPase pump** on the blood side (basolateral membrane) actively pumps K+ from the blood into the principal cell, creating a high intracellular K+ concentration.
    2.  **Luminal Secretion:** This high intracellular K+ concentration creates a chemical gradient favoring the movement of K+ out of the cell. K+ is secreted from the cell into the tubular lumen (urine) through two types of channels on the apical membrane: **ROMK** (Renal Outer Medullary K+ channel) and **Maxi-K** channels.
    3.  **Electrochemical Gradient:** The reabsorption of sodium (Na+) through the ENaC channel on the apical membrane makes the tubular lumen electrically negative. This negative charge provides an additional electrical driving force that promotes the secretion of positively charged K+ ions into the lumen.

**5. Describe the interaction between aldosterone, serum potassium, and sodium delivery and uptake in regulating urinary excretion of potassium.**

The regulation of urinary K+ excretion in the collecting duct is a complex interplay of three main factors:

1.  **Aldosterone:** This is the most important hormonal regulator. Aldosterone, released in response to high plasma K+ or activation of the RAAS, stimulates K+ secretion by:
    *   Increasing the activity of the basolateral Na+/K+-ATPase pump.
    *   Increasing the number and activity of ENaC channels, which enhances Na+ reabsorption and makes the lumen more negative.
    *   Increasing the number of open ROMK channels on the apical membrane.

2.  **Plasma Potassium [K+]:** High plasma K+ directly stimulates both aldosterone release from the adrenal glands and K+ secretion from the principal cells (by increasing the chemical gradient and stimulating the Na+/K+-ATPase pump).

3.  **Sodium Delivery and Flow Rate:** The amount of sodium and the rate of fluid flow to the collecting duct are critical determinants of K+ secretion.
    *   **High Sodium Delivery/Flow (e.g., with diuretics):** A high flow of tubular fluid washes away the secreted K+, maintaining a steep chemical gradient that favors further K+ secretion. Additionally, the delivery of more Na+ to the ENaC channel enhances Na+ reabsorption, making the lumen more negative and electrically favoring K+ secretion. This is why high flow states and diuretic use can lead to significant potassium wasting (hypokalemia).

*   **The Aldosterone Paradox:** This concept explains how the body can use aldosterone to regulate either volume or potassium balance without inappropriately affecting the other. In states of volume depletion, aldosterone is high, but distal sodium delivery is low (due to increased proximal reabsorption), so K+ secretion does not increase significantly. In states of high potassium intake, aldosterone is high and directly stimulates K+ secretion, but because volume is not depleted, distal sodium delivery is maintained, allowing for efficient K+ excretion.
