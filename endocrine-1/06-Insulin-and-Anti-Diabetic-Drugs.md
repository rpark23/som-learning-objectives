### Lecture 6: Insulin and Antidiabetic Drugs

**1. Understand endogenous insulin synthesis and secretion.**

*   **Synthesis:**
    *   Insulin is a peptide hormone synthesized in the beta-cells of the pancreas.
    *   It begins as **preproinsulin** mRNA, which is translated into the preproinsulin protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).
    *   In the ER, the "pre" segment (a signal peptide) is cleaved off, resulting in **proinsulin**.
    *   Proinsulin is transported to the Golgi apparatus, where it is packaged into secretory vesicles. Within these vesicles, proinsulin is cleaved into two parts: the active **insulin** molecule and a connecting peptide, called **C-peptide**.
    *   Insulin consists of two amino acid chains (A and B) linked by disulfide bonds. It is stored in the vesicles as hexamers (groups of six insulin molecules) stabilized by zinc ions.

*   **Secretion:**
    *   Insulin and C-peptide are secreted from the beta-cells in equimolar amounts (equal numbers of molecules).
    *   The primary trigger for secretion is high blood glucose. Glucose enters the beta-cell via the GLUT2 transporter and is metabolized, increasing the intracellular ATP/ADP ratio.
    *   This rise in ATP closes ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels, leading to depolarization of the cell membrane.
    *   Depolarization opens voltage-gated calcium (Ca++) channels. The resulting influx of calcium triggers the exocytosis (release) of the insulin-containing vesicles.
    *   Once secreted, the inactive hexamers dissociate into active monomers, which can then bind to insulin receptors on target tissues.

*   **Clinical Note on C-peptide:** Because C-peptide is secreted along with insulin but is not cleared by the liver (unlike insulin), measuring C-peptide levels is a useful way to assess the body's own (endogenous) insulin production, even in a patient who is taking exogenous insulin.

**2. Understand chemical modification strategies that alter insulin action profile.**

Synthetic insulin analogs are created by modifying the amino acid sequence of human insulin. These modifications are designed to change how quickly the insulin is absorbed and how long it acts in the body, allowing for the creation of insulins with different action profiles (rapid, short, intermediate, and long-acting).

The main strategy revolves around controlling how quickly the insulin hexamers dissociate into active monomers after subcutaneous injection:

*   **To Create Rapid-Acting Insulin (e.g., Lispro, Aspart, Glulisine):**
    *   **Strategy:** Modify amino acids to weaken the bonds holding the hexamer together.
    *   **Mechanism:** These analogs dissociate into active monomers very quickly after injection, resulting in a rapid onset of action that is better matched to the glucose rise from a meal.

*   **To Create Long-Acting Insulin (e.g., Glargine, Detemir, Degludec):**
    *   **Strategy 1: Change the Isoelectric Point (Glargine):** Add two arginine molecules and substitute another amino acid. This makes the insulin soluble at an acidic pH in the vial but causes it to form microprecipitates upon injection into the neutral pH of the subcutaneous tissue. The insulin then slowly dissolves from these precipitates, providing a slow, steady release.
    *   **Strategy 2: Bind to Albumin (Detemir):** Attach a fatty acid chain to the insulin molecule. This allows the insulin to bind to albumin, a common protein in the blood and subcutaneous tissue. This binding creates a depot from which the insulin is slowly released.
    *   **Strategy 3: Form Multi-Hexamers (Degludec):** Modify the insulin to form long, stable multi-hexamer chains upon injection. These chains slowly break down, releasing monomers over a very long period (ultra-long-acting).

*   **To Create Intermediate-Acting Insulin (NPH):**
    *   **Strategy:** Add protamine, a positively charged protein, to regular insulin. This causes the insulin to crystallize. After injection, these crystals dissolve slowly, delaying absorption and providing an intermediate duration of action.

**3. Know the action profiles of insulin analogs and how to treat with insulin.**

*   **Action Profiles:**
    *   **Rapid-Acting (Lispro, Aspart, Glulisine):** Onset: 5-15 min; Peak: 1-2 hrs; Duration: 3-6 hrs. Used as **prandial (mealtime)** insulin.
    *   **Short-Acting (Regular Human Insulin):** Onset: 30-60 min; Peak: 2-4 hrs; Duration: 6-10 hrs. Also used for meals, but its slower onset and longer tail are less ideal than rapid-acting analogs.
    *   **Intermediate-Acting (NPH):** Onset: 1.5 hrs; Peak: 4-12 hrs; Duration: 10-28 hrs. Often used as a basal insulin, but its pronounced peak can increase the risk of hypoglycemia.
    *   **Long-Acting (Glargine, Detemir):** Onset: 1.5 hrs; Peak: Relatively flat; Duration: ~20-24+ hrs. Used as **basal** insulin to provide steady, background coverage.
    *   **Ultra-Long-Acting (Degludec):** Onset: 1.5 hrs; Peak: Flat; Duration: 42+ hrs. Provides very stable basal coverage.

*   **How to Treat with Insulin (Basal-Bolus Therapy):**
    *   The goal is to mimic the body's natural insulin secretion pattern.
    *   **Basal Insulin:** A long-acting analog (like Glargine or Detemir) is given once or twice daily to cover the body's background needs.
    *   **Prandial (Bolus) Insulin:** A rapid-acting analog (like Lispro or Aspart) is given before each meal to cover the carbohydrates in the food. The dose is calculated based on the amount of carbohydrates to be eaten (the "carb ratio"). An additional "correction" dose may be added to bring down a high pre-meal blood sugar.
    *   **Intensive Insulin Therapy:** This approach involves calculating a total daily dose (TDD) of insulin (e.g., 0.5 units/kg of body weight). Typically, 50% of the TDD is given as basal insulin, and the other 50% is divided among the meals as prandial insulin.

**4. Know the different classes of non-insulin therapies.**

These medications are primarily used for Type 2 Diabetes and work through various mechanisms:

*   **Biguanides (Metformin):** First-line therapy. Primarily **decreases hepatic glucose production**. Also has minor effects on improving insulin sensitivity and decreasing glucose absorption.

*   **Sulfonylureas (SUs) & Glinides:** **Insulin secretagogues**. They stimulate the pancreas to release more insulin by acting on the KATP channel in beta-cells. Carry a risk of hypoglycemia.

*   **Thiazolidinediones (TZDs):** **Insulin sensitizers**. They act on PPAR-gamma in fat cells to improve insulin sensitivity, primarily by promoting the redistribution of fat away from the liver and muscle.

*   **Alpha-Glucosidase Inhibitors (AGIs):** Slow the absorption of carbohydrates from the gut by inhibiting the enzymes that break down complex sugars.

*   **GLP-1 Receptor Agonists (GLP-1 RAs):** Mimic the action of the natural incretin hormone GLP-1. They are glucose-dependent, meaning they primarily work when blood sugar is high. They **increase insulin secretion**, **suppress glucagon secretion**, slow gastric emptying, and promote satiety (leading to weight loss).

*   **DPP-4 Inhibitors:** Prevent the breakdown of the body's own GLP-1, thereby increasing its levels and enhancing its effects.

*   **SGLT2 Inhibitors:** Block the reabsorption of glucose in the kidneys, causing excess glucose to be excreted in the urine (**glucosuria**). This lowers blood glucose and promotes weight loss.

*   **Amylin Analogs:** Mimic the hormone amylin, which is co-secreted with insulin. They slow gastric emptying and suppress glucagon.

**5. Know the treatment goals for diabetes.**

The primary goals of diabetes management are to prevent acute complications and reduce the risk of long-term complications.

*   **Glycemic Control:**
    *   **HbA1c:** The primary target for long-term glucose control. The general goal is **< 7.0%**. Goals should be individualized.
    *   **Fasting/Premeal Glucose:** Typically aiming for 90-130 mg/dL.

*   **Cardiovascular (CV) Risk Reduction:** This is a major focus, especially in T2D.
    *   **Blood Pressure Control:** Goal is generally <140/90 mmHg, often lower (<130/80) in certain individuals.
    *   **Lipid Management:** Statin therapy is recommended for most patients to lower LDL cholesterol.
    *   **Medication Choice:** For patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), heart failure, or chronic kidney disease (CKD), specific classes of medications like **SGLT2 inhibitors** and **GLP-1 RAs** are recommended because they have been proven to reduce cardiovascular events and provide renal protection, independent of their glucose-lowering effects.
