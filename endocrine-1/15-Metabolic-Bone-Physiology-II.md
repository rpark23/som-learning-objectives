## 1. Osteoporosis

### Define osteoporosis

*   Osteoporosis, which literally means "porous bone," is a disease characterized by a reduction in bone mineral density and bone mass. This leads to a compromised bone structure and an increased risk of fracture.

### Describe ways to assess fracture risk

*   **Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan:** This is the standard method for measuring bone mineral density (BMD) at key sites like the spine, hip, and forearm.
*   **T-scores and Z-scores:**
    *   A **T-score** compares a patient's BMD to that of a healthy young adult (at peak bone mass). A T-score of -2.5 or lower is the diagnostic criterion for osteoporosis.
    *   A **Z-score** compares a patient's BMD to that of their peers of the same age and sex.
*   **FRAX (Fracture Risk Assessment Tool):** This is a computer-based algorithm that calculates the 10-year probability of a major osteoporotic fracture (hip, spine, forearm, or humerus) and the 10-year probability of a hip fracture. It incorporates BMD along with clinical risk factors such as age, sex, body mass index, previous fracture, parental history of hip fracture, smoking, alcohol intake, and glucocorticoid use.

### Describe approaches to treating osteoporosis

*   **Nutrition and Exercise:**
    *   Adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D is essential for bone health.
    *   Weight-bearing exercises (e.g., walking, jogging) and progressive resistance training (e.g., weight lifting) can help maintain or increase bone density.
*   **Pharmacologic Treatment:**
    *   **Antiresorptive Agents:** These medications slow down bone resorption.
        *   **Bisphosphonates** (e.g., alendronate, risedronate, zoledronic acid) are the most commonly prescribed drugs for osteoporosis.
        *   **Denosumab** is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits osteoclast formation and activity.
        *   **Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs)**, like raloxifene, have estrogen-like effects on bone.
    *   **Anabolic Agents:** These medications stimulate new bone formation.
        *   **Teriparatide** and **abaloparatide** are synthetic forms of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and PTH-related peptide (PTHrP), respectively.
    *   **Romosozumab:** A monoclonal antibody that blocks sclerostin, leading to both an increase in bone formation and a decrease in bone resorption.

## 2. Osteomalacia and rickets

### Describe pathophysiology and treatment of osteomalacia/rickets

*   **Pathophysiology:**
    *   **Osteomalacia** is a metabolic bone disease in adults characterized by impaired bone mineralization. **Rickets** is the equivalent disease in children, affecting the growing skeleton.
    *   The most common cause is severe **vitamin D deficiency**, which leads to decreased intestinal calcium and phosphate absorption. Other causes include disorders of phosphate metabolism and certain genetic conditions.
    *   The defective mineralization results in an accumulation of unmineralized osteoid, leading to soft, weak bones. This causes bone pain, muscle weakness, and an increased risk of fractures.
*   **Treatment:**
    *   The primary treatment is to correct the underlying cause. For vitamin D deficiency, this involves supplementation with high doses of vitamin D, along with adequate calcium intake.

## 3. Paget's disease

### Describe pathophysiology and treatment of Paget's disease

*   **Pathophysiology:**
    *   Paget's disease of bone is a chronic, focal disorder of bone remodeling. It is characterized by an initial phase of excessive bone resorption by abnormal, overactive osteoclasts, followed by a compensatory but disorganized and excessive phase of new bone formation by osteoblasts.
    *   The resulting bone is structurally abnormal, enlarged, and weakened, which can lead to bone pain, deformities, fractures, and arthritis in adjacent joints.
    *   The etiology is not fully understood but is thought to involve a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors, possibly a slow viral infection.
*   **Treatment:**
    *   **Bisphosphonates** are the mainstay of treatment. They are highly effective at suppressing the high bone turnover, which can alleviate bone pain and may prevent the progression of complications.
