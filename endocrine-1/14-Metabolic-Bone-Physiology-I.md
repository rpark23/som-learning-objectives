# Learning Objectives: Metabolic Bone Physiology I

## 1. Discuss regulation of mineral and vitamin D physiology

### Understand how calcium levels are regulated and how dysregulation can occur

*   **Regulation:** Calcium levels are tightly regulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH) and the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR). When blood calcium is low, the CaSR in the parathyroid gland is activated, leading to the secretion of PTH. PTH then acts on the bones to increase bone resorption (releasing calcium), on the kidneys to increase calcium reabsorption, and on the intestines (via activation of Vitamin D) to increase calcium absorption.
*   **Dysregulation:**
    *   **Hypercalcemia (High Calcium):** Can be PTH-dependent (e.g., primary hyperparathyroidism) or PTH-independent (e.g., malignancy, vitamin D toxicity). Symptoms include bone pain, kidney stones, and confusion.
    *   **Hypocalcemia (Low Calcium):** Can be caused by low PTH (e.g., postsurgical) or high PTH (e.g., vitamin D deficiency). Symptoms include numbness, tingling, and seizures.

### Understand how phosphate levels are regulated and how dysregulation can occur

*   **Regulation:** Phosphate levels are regulated by PTH and Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 (FGF23). PTH decreases phosphate reabsorption in the kidneys, while FGF23 increases urinary phosphate excretion.
*   **Dysregulation:**
    *   **Hyperphosphatemia:** Most commonly caused by kidney disease.
    *   **Hypophosphatemia:** Can be caused by malabsorption or excess FGF23.

### Understand the metabolism and actions of vitamin D and how dysregulation can occur

*   **Metabolism:** Vitamin D is synthesized in the skin upon UVB exposure or obtained from the diet. It is first hydroxylated in the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and then in the kidney to the active form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol), a process stimulated by PTH.
*   **Actions:** Calcitriol increases intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphorus. It also plays a role in bone resorption.
*   **Dysregulation:**
    *   **Vitamin D Deficiency:** Can lead to hypocalcemia.
    *   **Vitamin D Toxicity:** Can lead to hypercalcemia.

## 2. Discuss bone physiology

### Identify extracellular and cellular components of bone

*   **Extracellular:** The bone matrix is composed of organic components (mainly type I collagen) and inorganic components (hydroxyapatite mineral).
*   **Cellular:**
    *   **Osteoblasts:** Bone-forming cells.
    *   **Osteoclasts:** Bone-resorbing cells.
    *   **Osteocytes:** Mature bone cells that act as mechanosensors.

### Understand the roles of osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and osteocytes

*   **Osteoblasts:** Synthesize and secrete the organic matrix of bone (osteoid), which then becomes mineralized.
*   **Osteoclasts:** Break down bone tissue, releasing minerals into the bloodstream.
*   **Osteocytes:** Embedded in the bone matrix, they sense mechanical stress and regulate the activity of osteoblasts and osteoclasts.

### Understand the roles of two important systems regulating bone remodeling: the RANKL system and Wnt signaling

*   **RANKL system:** A key pathway for osteoclast differentiation and activation. RANKL, produced by osteoblasts and osteocytes, binds to its receptor RANK on osteoclast precursors, promoting their maturation. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a decoy receptor that blocks RANKL, inhibiting osteoclast activity.
*   **Wnt signaling:** A crucial pathway for bone formation. Wnt ligands promote the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into osteoblasts. Sclerostin, produced by osteocytes, is an inhibitor of the Wnt pathway.
