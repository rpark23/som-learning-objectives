### Lecture 9: Normal Histology of Endocrine Glands

**1. Define endocrine glands and identify the major endocrine glands and their locations.**

*   **Definition:** Endocrine glands are ductless glands composed of epithelial cells, arranged in cords or clusters, that secrete signaling molecules called **hormones** directly into the bloodstream. The hormones are then distributed throughout the body via the circulatory system to act on distant target cells.

*   **Major Glands and Locations:**
    *   **Pituitary Gland:** Located at the base of the brain, resting in the sella turcica.
    *   **Pineal Gland:** Located in the posterior part of the brain.
    *   **Thyroid Gland:** Located in the front of the neck, below the larynx.
    *   **Parathyroid Glands:** Typically four small glands located on the posterior surface of the thyroid gland.
    *   **Adrenal Glands:** Located on top of each kidney.
    *   **Pancreas (Islets of Langerhans):** Located in the abdomen, behind the stomach. The pancreas has both endocrine and exocrine functions.
    *   **Gonads:** Ovaries (in females) and Testes (in males).

**2. Review the 4 types of hormones by their different ways of acting on target cells.**

1.  **Endocrine:** The hormone is released into the bloodstream and travels to act on distant target cells. This is the most common mode of action for hormones.
2.  **Paracrine:** The hormone is released into the interstitial fluid and acts on nearby, neighboring cells.
3.  **Juxtacrine:** The signaling molecule remains on the surface of the secreting cell and acts on target cells only when they make direct contact.
4.  **Autocrine:** The hormone acts on the same cell that secreted it or on other cells of the same type.

**3. Appreciate the importance of feedback loops in endocrine function.**

Feedback loops are essential for the self-regulation of hormone production and for maintaining hormonal balance (homeostasis). The most common type is the **negative feedback loop**, where the final hormone in a pathway inhibits the secretion of the hormones that stimulated its release. For example, thyroid hormone from the thyroid gland inhibits the release of TSH from the pituitary and TRH from the hypothalamus. This prevents the overproduction of thyroid hormone.

**4. Understand the basic gross anatomical and histologic features of endocrine glands.**

*   **General Histologic Features:**
    *   **Cell Arrangement:** Endocrine cells are typically arranged in cords, clusters, or follicles.
    *   **"Bland" Appearance:** A common feature of many endocrine cells is a monotonous or "bland" appearance, characterized by polygonal cells with round nuclei and pale-staining cytoplasm.
    *   **Rich Vascular Supply:** Endocrine glands are highly vascularized with dense networks of fenestrated capillaries to allow for the efficient secretion of hormones into the bloodstream.

*   **Specific Gland Features:**
    *   **Pituitary Gland:** Divided into the anterior pituitary (adenohypophysis) and the posterior pituitary (neurohypophysis). The anterior pituitary contains a mixture of acidophils, basophils, and chromophobes. The posterior pituitary has a neural appearance, containing unmyelinated axons and glial cells called pituicytes.
    *   **Adrenal Gland:** Divided into an outer cortex and an inner medulla. The cortex has three distinct zones (glomerulosa, fasciculata, reticularis), each producing different steroid hormones. The medulla is composed of chromaffin cells that produce catecholamines.
    *   **Pancreas:** The endocrine component consists of the Islets of Langerhans, which appear as pale-staining clusters of cells embedded within the exocrine acinar tissue.
    *   **Thyroid Gland:** Uniquely characterized by its follicular structure. The follicles are spherical structures composed of follicular cells surrounding a central lumen filled with colloid, which is where thyroid hormone is stored.
    *   **Parathyroid Gland:** Composed mainly of small, polygonal principal (chief) cells. With age, these glands show significant fatty replacement.

**5. Recall the physiological function of the hormones included in this lecture.**

*   **Posterior Pituitary:**
    *   **ADH (Antidiuretic Hormone):** Increases water reabsorption in the kidneys.
    *   **Oxytocin:** Stimulates uterine contractions during childbirth and milk ejection during nursing.

*   **Anterior Pituitary:**
    *   **GH (Growth Hormone):** Stimulates growth in all body tissues.
    *   **Prolactin (PRL):** Stimulates milk production.
    *   **TSH (Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone):** Stimulates the thyroid gland.
    *   **ACTH (Adrenocorticotropic Hormone):** Stimulates the adrenal cortex.
    *   **FSH & LH (Gonadotropins):** Act on the gonads.

*   **Adrenal Cortex:**
    *   **Aldosterone (Mineralocorticoid):** Regulates salt and water balance.
    *   **Cortisol (Glucocorticoid):** A major stress hormone.
    *   **DHEA (Androgen):** A precursor to sex steroids.

*   **Adrenal Medulla:**
    *   **Epinephrine & Norepinephrine:** Mediate the "fight-or-flight" response.

*   **Pancreas:**
    *   **Insulin (from beta-cells):** Lowers blood glucose.
    *   **Glucagon (from alpha-cells):** Raises blood glucose.
    *   **Somatostatin (from delta-cells):** Inhibits the release of other islet hormones.

*   **Testis:**
    *   **Testosterone (from Leydig cells):** The primary male sex hormone.

*   **Thyroid:**
    *   **T3 & T4 (Thyroid Hormones):** Control the body's basal metabolic rate.
    *   **Calcitonin (from C-cells):** Lowers blood calcium levels.

*   **Parathyroid:**
    *   **PTH (Parathyroid Hormone):** The primary regulator of blood calcium, acting to increase its levels.

*   **Pineal Gland:**
    *   **Melatonin:** Regulates circadian rhythms (the sleep-wake cycle).

**6. Learn similarities and differences between endocrine cell physiology and histology according to different organ locations.**

*   **Similarities:**
    *   Many endocrine cells across different organs share a similar bland, polygonal appearance with round nuclei (e.g., principal cells of the parathyroid, islet cells of the pancreas, cells of the adrenal cortex).
    *   The fundamental principle of hormone secretion into a rich network of capillaries is a universal feature.
    *   Hormones can be broadly categorized as hydrophilic (peptides, proteins, catecholamines) acting on cell surface receptors, or hydrophobic (steroids, thyroid hormone) acting on intracellular receptors.

*   **Differences:**
    *   **Embryologic Origin:** The origin dictates the cell type. For example, the adrenal cortex (from mesoderm) produces steroids, while the adrenal medulla (from neural crest) produces catecholamines. The anterior pituitary (from oral ectoderm) is distinct from the posterior pituitary (from neural ectoderm).
    *   **Histologic Arrangement:** The cellular organization is unique to the gland's function. The thyroid's follicular structure is for storing large amounts of hormone extracellularly. The adrenal cortex is zoned for producing different classes of steroids. The pancreas has islets scattered within an exocrine gland.
    *   **Cell Types:** Some glands, like the anterior pituitary and pancreatic islets, are composed of multiple, distinct hormone-producing cell types intermingled, whereas others, like the adrenal cortex zones, have a more uniform cell population within each layer.
