### Lecture 11: Hyperkalemia and Hypokalemia

**1. Recognize that both hypokalemia and hyperkalemia pose a significant threat to life.**

Both high (hyperkalemia) and low (hypokalemia) levels of plasma potassium are medical emergencies because of their profound effects on the resting membrane potential of excitable cells. This is especially critical for cardiac and neuromuscular function.

*   **Hypokalemia (Low K+):** Can cause muscle weakness, fatigue, paralysis, and respiratory failure due to diaphragmatic weakness. On an EKG, it can cause flattened T waves, ST depression, and prominent U waves, and it significantly increases the risk of life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias like Torsades de Pointes.

*   **Hyperkalemia (High K+):** Can also cause muscle weakness and paralysis. Its cardiac effects are particularly dangerous and can progress rapidly. EKG changes include peaked T waves, prolonged PR interval, loss of P waves, and widening of the QRS complex, which can devolve into a "sine wave" pattern, ventricular fibrillation, and asystole (cardiac arrest).

**2. Categorize the causes of hypokalemia and hyperkalemia.**

The causes for both conditions can be broadly categorized into three main groups:

*   **Intake:** Abnormally low or high intake of potassium.
*   **Shift:** Redistribution of potassium between the intracellular (ICF) and extracellular (ECF) compartments.
*   **Excretion:** Abnormal losses or retention of potassium, primarily by the kidneys or GI tract.

**3. Understand the factors that affect distal K+ secretion and apply this to explain the development of K+ disorders with a renal cause.**

Urinary potassium excretion is primarily determined by K+ secretion in the principal cells of the distal nephron (collecting tubule). The key factors regulating this secretion are:

1.  **Aldosterone:** The primary hormonal regulator. Aldosterone increases K+ secretion.
2.  **Distal Sodium Delivery and Flow:** High flow and high sodium delivery to the distal nephron enhance K+ secretion.
3.  **Plasma [K+] Level:** High plasma K+ directly stimulates K+ secretion.

*   **Application to K+ Disorders (Renal Causes):**
    *   **Hypokalemia (Renal K+ Wasting):** Occurs when there is an inappropriate increase in distal K+ secretion. This is typically caused by:
        *   **High Aldosterone States:** (e.g., primary hyperaldosteronism) which directly drive K+ secretion.
        *   **Increased Distal Na+ Delivery/Flow:** (e.g., use of loop or thiazide diuretics) which creates a favorable gradient for K+ secretion.
    *   **Hyperkalemia (Decreased Renal K+ Excretion):** Occurs when there is impaired distal K+ secretion. This is typically caused by:
        *   **Reduced GFR:** In advanced kidney disease, the reduced number of functioning nephrons limits the ability to excrete potassium.
        *   **Aldosterone Deficiency or Resistance:** (e.g., Addison's disease, medications like ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or spironolactone) which impairs the primary signal for K+ secretion.
        *   **Low Distal Na+ Delivery/Flow:** In states of severe volume depletion, the low flow to the distal nephron can limit K+ secretion, even if aldosterone is high.

**4. Differentiate the reviewed causes of hypokalemia and hyperkalemia based on clinical and laboratory findings.**

*   **Hypokalemia:**
    *   **Transcellular Shift:** (e.g., due to excess insulin or alkalosis). This is an acute condition. Total body potassium is normal.
    *   **GI Loss:** (e.g., diarrhea). Often associated with a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis. The kidneys should respond appropriately by conserving potassium, leading to a **low urine K+**.
    *   **Renal Wasting:** (e.g., diuretic use, hyperaldosteronism). The kidneys are the cause of the potassium loss. This is characterized by an **inappropriately high urine K+** in the setting of hypokalemia. It is often associated with metabolic alkalosis.

*   **Hyperkalemia:**
    *   **Transcellular Shift:** (e.g., from metabolic acidosis, cell lysis). This is an acute condition.
    *   **Increased Intake:** Rarely a cause on its own but can be a major contributor in patients with impaired excretion.
    *   **Decreased Renal Excretion:** This is the most common cause of chronic hyperkalemia. It is due to kidney disease or impaired aldosterone function (e.g., from medications like ACE inhibitors/ARBs). Lab findings will show evidence of kidney disease (high creatinine/low GFR) or hormonal abnormalities.
    *   **Pseudohyperkalemia:** A falsely elevated K+ level due to lysis of red blood cells during or after the blood draw. The patient is asymptomatic, and the EKG is normal. A repeat, careful blood draw will show a normal K+ level.

**5. Understand that treatment of potassium imbalance depends on treating the underlying etiology.**

While emergency measures are taken to manage life-threatening potassium levels, the definitive treatment always involves identifying and correcting the underlying cause.

*   **Emergency Treatment for Hyperkalemia:** This is a three-step process:
    1.  **Antagonize Cardiac Effects:** Give **intravenous calcium gluconate** to stabilize the cardiac membrane and protect against arrhythmias. This does not lower the serum K+.
    2.  **Shift K+ from ECF to ICF:** Give **insulin** (with glucose to prevent hypoglycemia) and/or **beta-agonists** (albuterol) to temporarily move potassium into the cells.
    3.  **Remove K+ from the Body:** Enhance potassium excretion using **diuretics**, **cation exchange resins** (GI binders), or, in severe cases, **dialysis**.

*   **Treatment for Hypokalemia:**
    *   **Replace Potassium:** Give potassium supplements, either orally or intravenously.
    *   **Replace Magnesium:** Hypomagnesemia often co-exists with and exacerbates hypokalemia by promoting renal K+ wasting. It is essential to correct any magnesium deficiency to allow for effective potassium repletion.
    *   **Treat the Cause:** Address the underlying reason for the potassium loss (e.g., stop a diuretic, treat diarrhea, manage hyperaldosteronism).
