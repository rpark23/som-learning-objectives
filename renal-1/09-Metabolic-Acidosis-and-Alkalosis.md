### Lecture 9: Metabolic Acidosis and Alkalosis

**1. Explain the relationship between H+ concentration (pH), breathing, and PCO2.**

This relationship is central to understanding respiratory compensation for metabolic acid-base disorders. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation can be simplified to `[H+] = 24 * PCO2 / [HCO3-]`. This shows that the H+ concentration (and thus pH) is determined by the ratio of PCO2 (controlled by the lungs) to HCO3- (controlled by the kidneys).

*   **Relationship:** Breathing directly controls the level of PCO2 in the blood. When the body detects a change in pH caused by a metabolic problem (a change in HCO3-), the respiratory system responds to adjust the PCO2 in the same direction to mitigate the pH change.
*   **Metabolic Acidosis:** If HCO3- falls (e.g., due to the addition of an acid), the [H+] increases (pH falls). The body responds by **increasing ventilation** (hyperventilating) to blow off CO2. This **lowers the PCO2**, which helps to bring the [H+]/pH back toward normal.
*   **Metabolic Alkalosis:** If HCO3- rises, the [H+] falls (pH rises). The body responds by **decreasing ventilation** (hypoventilating) to retain CO2. This **raises the PCO2**, which helps to bring the [H+]/pH back toward normal.

**2. Be familiar with tables or diagrams that relate change in PCO2 to a change in the H+ concentration.**

For any primary metabolic acid-base disorder, there is a predictable compensatory respiratory response. These rules of thumb are used to determine if the respiratory response is appropriate.

*   **Metabolic Acidosis:** The expected PCO2 can be estimated. For every **1 mEq/L decrease** in serum [HCO3-], the PCO2 should decrease by approximately **1.2 mmHg**. A common clinical formula is **Winter's formula**: `Expected PCO2 = (1.5 * [HCO3-]) + 8 ± 2`. If the actual measured PCO2 is significantly different from the expected value, it indicates a mixed acid-base disorder (i.e., a concurrent respiratory acidosis or alkalosis).

*   **Metabolic Alkalosis:** For every **1 mEq/L increase** in serum [HCO3-], the PCO2 should increase by approximately **0.7 mmHg**.

Acid-base nomograms are diagrams that graphically represent these relationships, allowing one to plot a patient's pH, PCO2, and HCO3- to determine the nature of the acid-base disorder.

**3. Understand that the pH is determined by the kidney (which maintains the normal HCO3- concentration) and the respiratory system (which maintains the normal PCO2).**

This is the core concept of acid-base physiology. The pH of the blood is not determined by any single value, but by the **ratio** of the base component to the acid component of the bicarbonate buffer system.

*   **Kidney (Metabolic Component):** Regulates plasma [HCO3-].
*   **Lungs (Respiratory Component):** Regulates the partial pressure of CO2 (PCO2).

An acid-base disorder is defined by the primary change. A **metabolic** disorder is a primary change in [HCO3-], and a **respiratory** disorder is a primary change in PCO2. The body then uses the other system to compensate.

**4. Understand that the kidney maintains the normal bicarbonate concentration by excreting H+ in the urine.**

The body produces a significant amount of non-volatile acid from metabolism every day. To prevent a progressive metabolic acidosis, the kidneys must excrete this daily acid load. They do this by secreting H+ into the urine. This process is inextricably linked to the generation of new bicarbonate. For every H+ ion the kidney excretes into the urine (either as titratable acid or as ammonium, NH4+), it generates one new HCO3- ion that is returned to the blood. This process replenishes the bicarbonate that was consumed in buffering the metabolic acids, thereby maintaining a normal plasma bicarbonate concentration.

**5. Know what increases plasma bicarbonate concentration and what prevents excretion of the excess bicarbonate.**

Metabolic alkalosis is a state of high plasma bicarbonate concentration. It is generated by a net gain of bicarbonate or a loss of H+ from the body. However, for the alkalosis to be *maintained*, the kidneys must be prevented from excreting the excess bicarbonate.

*   **Generation of Alkalosis:**
    *   **H+ Loss:** Vomiting (loss of HCl), use of loop or thiazide diuretics (which increase renal H+ excretion).
    *   **Bicarbonate Gain:** Ingestion of large amounts of bicarbonate or other alkali.

*   **Maintenance of Alkalosis (Prevention of Bicarbonate Excretion):**
    *   The kidney's ability to excrete bicarbonate is impaired by factors that enhance tubular reabsorption. The most important factor is **effective circulating volume depletion**. When the body senses low volume, it activates the RAAS. The resulting high levels of Angiotensin II and aldosterone strongly stimulate sodium reabsorption in the nephron. Because bicarbonate is reabsorbed along with sodium (especially in the proximal tubule), the drive to retain sodium and preserve volume overrides the need to excrete bicarbonate, thus maintaining the alkalosis.

**6. Understand how the anion gap is used to assess metabolic acidosis.**

The anion gap is a crucial tool for evaluating a patient with metabolic acidosis.

*   **Concept:** It is a calculated value representing the difference between the major measured cation (Na+) and the major measured anions (Cl- and HCO3-). `AG = [Na+] - ([Cl⁻] + [HCO₃⁻])`.

*   **Utility:** It divides metabolic acidosis into two main categories:
    1.  **High Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis (AGMA):** This is caused by the addition of an unmeasured acid to the body (e.g., lactic acid, ketoacids, salicylates, etc.). The bicarbonate is consumed by buffering the acid, and the anion of that acid (lactate, acetoacetate) replaces it, increasing the anion gap. The mnemonic **MUDPILES** helps remember the common causes.
    2.  **Normal Anion Gap (Non-Gap) Metabolic Acidosis:** This is caused by a direct loss of bicarbonate (e.g., from diarrhea) or by impaired renal acid excretion (Renal Tubular Acidosis - RTA). The kidney compensates for the lost HCO3- by retaining Cl-, so the anion gap remains normal. This is also called a hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.
