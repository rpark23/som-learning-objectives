### Lecture 6: Disorders of Water Balance

**1. Define hyponatremia and hypernatremia.**

*   **Hyponatremia:** A state of low plasma sodium concentration, defined as **[Na+] < 135 mEq/L**. It represents a relative **excess of water** in the body compared to sodium.
*   **Hypernatremia:** A state of high plasma sodium concentration, defined as **[Na+] > 145 mEq/L**. It represents a relative **deficit of water** in the body compared to sodium.

**2. Recognize that disorders of tonicity primarily relate to ICF volume.**

Disorders of tonicity (i.e., changes in the effective osmolarity of the plasma, which is mainly determined by sodium concentration) directly impact the volume of the Intracellular Fluid (ICF). Because water moves freely across cell membranes to maintain osmotic equilibrium, any change in the ECF tonicity will cause water to shift into or out of the cells.

*   **Hyponatremia (low tonicity):** Leads to water moving **into** cells, causing them to swell. This results in an **increased ICF volume**.
*   **Hypernatremia (high tonicity):** Leads to water moving **out of** cells, causing them to shrink. This results in a **decreased ICF volume**.

**3. Understand that water excess is the major cause of hyponatremia.**

Hyponatremia is fundamentally a problem of too much water, not too little sodium. It develops when water intake exceeds the kidney's ability to excrete water. This inability to excrete free water is almost always due to the presence of **Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH)**, which prevents the kidneys from producing dilute urine.

**4. Understand that water loss is the major cause of hypernatremia.**

Hypernatremia is fundamentally a problem of not enough water. It develops when water losses (from renal or non-renal sources) are not adequately replaced. This is almost always due to an impaired thirst mechanism or a lack of access to water, as a healthy thirst mechanism is a very powerful defense against hypernatremia.

**5. Apply basic pathophysiology of water handling to diagnose causes of hyponatremia.**

The diagnostic approach to hyponatremia involves determining *why* the kidneys are not appropriately excreting free water (i.e., why ADH is present when it should be suppressed).

1.  **Confirm Hypotonic Hyponatremia:** First, measure serum osmolality to confirm it is low. (This rules out rare cases of isotonic or hypertonic hyponatremia).
2.  **Assess Renal Water Excretion:** Measure the **urine osmolality**.
    *   **If Urine Osmolality is low (< 100 mOsm/L):** This indicates that ADH is appropriately suppressed, and the kidneys are correctly producing dilute urine. The hyponatremia is therefore due to an overwhelming intake of free water that exceeds the kidney's maximum excretory capacity. This occurs in:
        *   **Primary Polydipsia:** A psychiatric condition involving massive water intake.
        *   **Low Solute Intake ("Beer Potomania," "Tea and Toast" diet):** A very low intake of solutes (osmoles) limits the kidney's ability to excrete water.
    *   **If Urine Osmolality is high (> 100 mOsm/L):** This indicates that ADH is present and is preventing the kidneys from excreting free water. The next step is to determine if the ADH release is appropriate or inappropriate.
3.  **Assess Volume Status (to determine if ADH is appropriate):**
    *   **Hypovolemic Hyponatremia:** If the patient is volume depleted (e.g., from diarrhea, vomiting, diuretics), the low effective circulating volume is an **appropriate** stimulus for ADH release. The body is sacrificing tonicity to preserve blood pressure.
    *   **Hypervolemic Hyponatremia:** In states like congestive heart failure and cirrhosis, although the total body volume is high (edema), the *effective* circulating volume is low. This is also an **appropriate** stimulus for ADH release.
    *   **Euvolemic Hyponatremia:** If the patient appears to have a normal volume status, then the ADH release is **inappropriate**. This is the **Syndrome of Inappropriate ADH (SIADH)**. SIADH can be caused by various factors, including CNS disorders, pulmonary diseases, malignancies, and certain drugs.

**6. Know there are subtypes of hyponatremia based on ECF volume.**

As described above, once it is determined that hyponatremia is due to the presence of ADH (high urine osmolality), patients are clinically categorized by their ECF volume status to narrow the diagnosis:

*   **Hypovolemic Hyponatremia:** Low ECF volume (e.g., dehydration).
*   **Euvolemic Hyponatremia:** Normal ECF volume (e.g., SIADH).
*   **Hypervolemic Hyponatremia:** High ECF volume (e.g., heart failure, cirrhosis).

**7. Be able to distinguish disorders of volume (sodium content) and water (sodium concentration).**

This is a crucial distinction:

*   **Disorders of Volume (Sodium Content):**
    *   Reflect the **total amount of sodium** in the body, which determines the **ECF volume**.
    *   Assessed by the **physical exam** (e.g., blood pressure, jugular venous distention, presence of edema).
    *   **Volume Depletion (Hypovolemia):** A deficit of total body sodium and water.
    *   **Volume Overload (Hypervolemia):** An excess of total body sodium and water.

*   **Disorders of Water (Sodium Concentration):**
    *   Reflect the **ratio of water to sodium**, which determines the plasma **tonicity** and **ICF volume**.
    *   Assessed by the **plasma sodium concentration [Na+]**.
    *   **Hyponatremia:** A relative excess of water.
    *   **Hypernatremia:** A relative deficit of water.
