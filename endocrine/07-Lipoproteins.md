### Lecture 7: Lipoproteins

**1. Describe the comparative size and structure of lipoproteins; function of chylomicrons and VLDL particles to triglycerides and FFAs to tissues; function of lipoproteins to deliver cholesterol to tissues; function of HDL particles to reuptake cholesterol from tissues.**

*   **Structure and Size:**
    *   Lipoproteins are complex spherical particles that transport hydrophobic lipids (triglycerides and cholesterol) through the aqueous environment of the blood.
    *   They have a central core of nonpolar lipids (triglyceride and cholesteryl esters) surrounded by a single outer layer of amphipathic lipids (phospholipids and free cholesterol) and proteins (apolipoproteins).
    *   They vary in size and density. The order from largest and least dense to smallest and most dense is: **Chylomicrons > VLDL > IDL > LDL > HDL**.
        *   **Chylomicrons:** Largest, highest in triglycerides (80-95%).
        *   **VLDL (Very Low-Density Lipoprotein):** Rich in triglycerides (45-65%).
        *   **LDL (Low-Density Lipoprotein):** Rich in cholesterol (45-50%).
        *   **HDL (High-Density Lipoprotein):** Rich in protein (45-55%).

*   **Function of Chylomicrons and VLDL (Triglyceride Delivery):**
    *   **Chylomicrons:** Their primary function is to transport **dietary (exogenous)** triglycerides from the intestine to peripheral tissues like adipose tissue (for storage) and muscle (for energy).
    *   **VLDL:** Their primary function is to transport **endogenously synthesized** triglycerides from the liver to peripheral tissues.
    *   In both cases, the enzyme **lipoprotein lipase (LPL)**, located on the surface of capillaries in peripheral tissues, hydrolyzes the triglycerides within these particles, releasing free fatty acids (FFAs) that are then taken up by the cells.

*   **Function of LDL (Cholesterol Delivery):**
    *   LDL is the primary carrier of cholesterol to peripheral tissues. Cells that need cholesterol for functions like membrane synthesis or steroid hormone production take up LDL particles via the **LDL receptor**.

*   **Function of HDL (Reverse Cholesterol Transport):**
    *   HDL's primary role is **reverse cholesterol transport**. It retrieves excess cholesterol from peripheral tissues and transports it back to the liver for excretion or recycling. This is a key anti-atherogenic function.

**2. Describe the function of the key apolipoproteins: B-48 and E for chylomicron remnant recognition and reuptake; B-100 for LDL-receptor recognition; CII for activation of lipoprotein lipase.**

Apolipoproteins are proteins on the surface of lipoproteins that have several key functions, including providing structural integrity, acting as cofactors for enzymes, and serving as ligands for receptors.

*   **Apo B-48:**
    *   **Function:** The primary structural protein of **chylomicrons**. It is essential for the assembly and secretion of chylomicrons from the intestine. It is a truncated version of Apo B-100.

*   **Apo E:**
    *   **Function:** Acts as a ligand for receptor-mediated uptake of remnant particles. It is recognized by receptors in the liver (like the LDL receptor and LRP1), allowing for the clearance of **chylomicron remnants** and **VLDL remnants (IDL)** from the circulation.

*   **Apo B-100:**
    *   **Function:** The primary structural protein of **VLDL, IDL, and LDL**. A single molecule of Apo B-100 is present on each of these particles. Its most critical function is to act as the ligand that binds to the **LDL receptor**, mediating the clearance of LDL from the blood.

*   **Apo C-II:**
    *   **Function:** Acts as an essential **activator (cofactor) for lipoprotein lipase (LPL)**. When a chylomicron or VLDL particle reaches a peripheral tissue, Apo C-II on its surface activates LPL, allowing the enzyme to break down the triglycerides within the particle.

**3. Discuss endogenous (VLDL) and exogenous (chylomicron) lipid pathways.**

*   **Exogenous Pathway (Dietary Lipids):**
    1.  **Absorption:** Dietary fats (triglycerides) are absorbed in the intestine.
    2.  **Chylomicron Assembly:** Inside intestinal cells, triglycerides and cholesterol are packaged with Apo B-48 to form nascent **chylomicrons**.
    3.  **Secretion & Maturation:** Chylomicrons are secreted into the lymph and enter the bloodstream. In circulation, they acquire Apo C-II and Apo E from HDL particles to become mature chylomicrons.
    4.  **Triglyceride Delivery:** In peripheral tissues, Apo C-II activates LPL, which breaks down the triglycerides, releasing fatty acids to be used or stored by the cells.
    5.  **Remnant Formation & Clearance:** As triglycerides are removed, the chylomicron shrinks and becomes a **chylomicron remnant**. These remnants are rich in cholesterol and are rapidly cleared from the circulation by the liver, which recognizes Apo E on their surface.

*   **Endogenous Pathway (Hepatic Lipids):**
    1.  **VLDL Assembly:** The liver packages endogenously synthesized triglycerides and cholesterol with Apo B-100 to form **VLDL** particles.
    2.  **Secretion & Maturation:** VLDL is secreted directly into the bloodstream. Like chylomicrons, it acquires Apo C-II and Apo E from HDL.
    3.  **Triglyceride Delivery:** LPL, activated by Apo C-II, hydrolyzes the triglycerides in VLDL, delivering fatty acids to peripheral tissues.
    4.  **IDL Formation:** As VLDL loses triglycerides, it becomes a smaller, denser particle called **IDL (Intermediate-Density Lipoprotein)** or a VLDL remnant.
    5.  **IDL Fate:** Some IDL is cleared by the liver via Apo E. The rest is further modified by hepatic lipase, which removes more triglycerides, converting the IDL into **LDL (Low-Density Lipoprotein)**.
    6.  **LDL Clearance:** LDL, which is now primarily a cholesterol-rich particle with Apo B-100 on its surface, circulates in the blood until it is cleared by the LDL receptor, mainly in the liver.

**4. Recognize different lipoprotein abnormalities and classifications of hyperlipidemia.**

Hyperlipidemia is the condition of having abnormally high levels of lipids in the blood. It can be classified based on which lipoproteins are elevated.

*   **High Cholesterol States (Hypercholesterolemia):**
    *   **Primary Abnormality:** Elevated **LDL-C**.
    *   **Genetic Causes:** Can be caused by single-gene defects like Familial Hypercholesterolemia (mutations in *LDLR*, *APOB*, or *PCSK9*) or can be polygenic.
    *   **Secondary Causes:** Hypothyroidism, cholestatic liver disease, nephrotic syndrome.

*   **High Triglyceride States (Hypertriglyceridemia):**
    *   **Primary Abnormality:** Elevated **VLDL** and/or **chylomicrons**.
    *   **Genetic Causes:** Can be polygenic or due to single-gene defects affecting triglyceride clearance (e.g., mutations in *LPL*, *APOC2*).
    *   **Secondary Causes:** Uncontrolled diabetes, obesity, alcohol excess, certain medications (e.g., oral estrogens).
    *   **Clinical Manifestation:** Very high levels can cause eruptive xanthomas and pancreatitis.

*   **Combined Hyperlipidemia:**
    *   **Primary Abnormality:** Elevated **LDL-C** and **Triglycerides**.
    *   **Cause:** Often polygenic and associated with metabolic syndrome.

*   **Low HDL States:**
    *   **Primary Abnormality:** Low levels of **HDL-C**.
    *   **Causes:** Can be genetic (e.g., mutations in *ABCA1*, *APOA1*) or secondary to factors like smoking, obesity, and certain medications.

*   **Elevated Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)]:**
    *   **Abnormality:** Lp(a) is an LDL-like particle with an additional protein, apolipoprotein(a), attached. High levels are a genetic and causal risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).
