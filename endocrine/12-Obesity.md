### Lecture 12: Obesity

**1. Understand Body Mass Index (BMI).**

*   **Definition:** BMI is a measure of body fat based on height and weight, calculated as weight (kg) / [height (m)]^2.
*   **Classification:**
    *   <25: Normal
    *   25-29.9: Overweight
    *   â‰¥30: Obese
*   **Caveat:** BMI is a crude population-level statistic and can be misleading for individuals. It does not distinguish between fat mass and muscle mass. For example, an athlete with high muscle mass may have a high BMI without being over-fat (e.g., George Kittle).

**2. Understand the prevalence of obesity in the U.S. and disparities based on race/ethnicity, education level, and income.**

*   **Prevalence:** Obesity is a major epidemic in the U.S., with over 40% of adults being obese and a third being overweight. The prevalence has dramatically increased over the past few decades.
*   **Disparities:** Significant disparities exist. The prevalence of obesity is higher in non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic populations compared to non-Hispanic white and Asian populations. In women, obesity prevalence increases with decreasing socioeconomic status (income) and lower levels of educational attainment across all ethnic groups.

**3. Understand health consequences of obesity.**

*   Obesity is a complex disease associated with numerous co-morbidities and increased mortality.
*   **Metabolic Consequences:** It is strongly linked to insulin resistance and a 7-fold increased risk of developing **Type 2 Diabetes**. It is also associated with dyslipidemia and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), now called MASLD.
*   **Cardiovascular Consequences:** Increases the risk of hypertension, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and thrombosis.
*   **Other Consequences:** Associated with inflammation, arthritis, obstructive sleep apnea, and an increased risk of at least 13 different types of cancer.

**4. Describe how much weight loss is needed to decrease obesity-associated co-morbidities.**

*   Even modest weight loss can have significant health benefits. The landmark Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) showed that a weight loss of just 5-7% of body weight, achieved through intensive lifestyle intervention, could reduce the progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes by 58%.
*   The FDA has set the threshold for the approval of new weight-loss drugs at a mean weight loss of at least 5% greater than placebo.

**5. Appreciate results achieved from medical approaches to obesity management, including newer drugs.**

*   **Hormonal Conspiracy:** It is difficult to lose weight and maintain it because the body mounts a compensatory hormonal response. Hormones that promote appetite (like ghrelin) increase, while hormones that promote satiety (like leptin, amylin, and peptide YY) decrease.
*   **Oral Medications:** Combination therapies like Phentermine/Topiramate (Qsymia) and Bupropion/Naltrexone (Contrave) can achieve approximately 6-12% weight loss.
*   **Injectable Incretins (Game Changers):**
    *   **Liraglutide (Saxenda):** A GLP-1 receptor agonist, showed that this class of diabetes drugs could also produce significant weight loss (~5-6% more than placebo).
    *   **Semaglutide (Wegovy):** A more potent, weekly GLP-1 receptor agonist, approved for weight loss, achieves approximately 13-14% greater weight loss than placebo.
    *   **Tirzepatide (Zepbound):** A dual GLP-1 and GIP receptor agonist, is even more effective, inducing weight loss of approximately 20% greater than placebo.
*   **MACE Reduction:** Importantly, weekly injectable semaglutide has been shown to significantly reduce Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) in patients with obesity and pre-existing cardiovascular disease.

**6. Appreciate results achieved from surgical approaches to obesity management.**

*   **Bariatric Surgery:** Surgical procedures like the Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass are the most effective treatments for severe obesity, leading to substantial and durable weight loss (e.g., ~25% at 15 years).
*   **Mechanical Methods:** Other less invasive, mechanical methods like the intragastric balloon system have been developed to induce satiety.

**7. Understand how new drugs are closing the "treatment gap" in the management of obesity.**

*   Historically, there was a large "treatment gap" between the modest efficacy of lifestyle interventions and the high efficacy (but also high risk) of bariatric surgery. The new, highly effective incretin-based medications (semaglutide, tirzepatide) are closing this gap, providing a powerful medical option for significant weight loss.
