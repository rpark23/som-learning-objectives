### Lecture 8: Treatment of Hyperlipidemia

**1. Describe the indications for lipid lowering therapy.**

The primary indication for lipid-lowering therapy is the reduction of risk for Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD), which includes events like heart attacks and strokes. Treatment is a spectrum from primordial/primary prevention to secondary prevention, with the intensity of therapy increasing with higher patient risk.

*   **Primary Prevention (patients without clinical ASCVD):**
    *   The decision to initiate therapy is based on a patient's 10-year ASCVD risk, which is calculated using risk estimators that consider factors like age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, smoking status, and diabetes.
    *   **LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL:** These individuals are considered to have severe hypercholesterolemia (often genetic, like Familial Hypercholesterolemia) and should be started on high-intensity statin therapy without a formal risk calculation.
    *   **Diabetes Mellitus (Age 40-75):** All individuals with diabetes in this age group should be on at least a moderate-intensity statin.
    *   **Age 40-75 without Diabetes:** For this large group, the 10-year ASCVD risk score guides the decision:
        *   **Low Risk (<5%):** Lifestyle modifications are emphasized.
        *   **Borderline Risk (5% to <7.5%):** A clinician-patient risk discussion is had. If risk-enhancing factors are present, statin therapy may be considered.
        *   **Intermediate Risk (≥7.5% to <20%):** Moderate-intensity statin therapy is recommended, aiming to lower LDL-C by 30-49%.
        *   **High Risk (≥20%):** High-intensity statin therapy is recommended, aiming to lower LDL-C by ≥50%.

*   **Secondary Prevention (patients with known clinical ASCVD, e.g., a prior heart attack or stroke):**
    *   These patients are automatically considered high-risk.
    *   The goal is aggressive LDL-C lowering. High-intensity statin therapy is the standard of care, with the goal of achieving an LDL-C level < 70 mg/dL. If this goal is not met on a maximally tolerated statin, other non-statin drugs are added.

*   **Severe Hypertriglyceridemia:**
    *   For patients with very high triglycerides (TGs > 500 mg/dL, and especially > 1000 mg/dL), the primary indication for therapy is to **prevent pancreatitis**, a painful and potentially fatal inflammation of the pancreas.

**2. Discuss the mechanisms of action of lipid lowering drugs: HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, fibric acid derivatives, omega-3 fatty acids, bile acid-binding resins, inhibitors of intestinal sterol adsorption, inhibitors of PCSK9.**

*   **HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors (Statins):**
    *   **Mechanism:** Statins are the cornerstone of LDL-C lowering. They competitively inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis in the liver. By reducing the liver's production of cholesterol, they cause the liver cells to upregulate (increase the number of) LDL receptors on their surface. These receptors then pull more LDL-C out of the bloodstream, thus lowering plasma LDL-C levels.

*   **Inhibitors of Intestinal Sterol Adsorption (Ezetimibe):**
    *   **Mechanism:** Ezetimibe inhibits the NPC1L1 transporter in the small intestine, which is responsible for absorbing dietary and biliary cholesterol. This reduces the amount of cholesterol delivered to the liver, which, similar to statins, causes an upregulation of hepatic LDL receptors and increased clearance of LDL-C from the blood.

*   **PCSK9 Inhibitors (Evolocumab, Alirocumab):**
    *   **Mechanism:** PCSK9 is a protein that binds to LDL receptors and targets them for degradation. By inhibiting PCSK9 (using monoclonal antibodies), these drugs prevent the breakdown of LDL receptors. This increases the number of LDL receptors available on the liver surface to clear LDL-C from the blood, leading to very potent LDL-C reduction.

*   **Bile Acid-Binding Resins (Sequestrants; e.g., Colesevelam):**
    *   **Mechanism:** These are non-absorbable polymers that bind to bile acids (which are made from cholesterol) in the intestine, preventing their reabsorption. The liver then has to use more of its own cholesterol to synthesize new bile acids. This depletion of hepatic cholesterol leads to the upregulation of LDL receptors and increased LDL-C clearance.

*   **Fibric Acid Derivatives (Fibrates; e.g., Fenofibrate):**
    *   **Mechanism:** Fibrates are primarily used to lower triglycerides. They act as PPAR-alpha agonists. This activation increases the synthesis of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), the enzyme that breaks down triglycerides in VLDL and chylomicrons, and decreases the production of Apo C-III (an inhibitor of LPL).

*   **Omega-3 Fatty Acids (e.g., Icosapent Ethyl):**
    *   **Mechanism:** These agents, particularly the purified EPA form (icosapent ethyl), lower triglycerides by reducing the liver's synthesis and secretion of VLDL particles. The exact mechanism is complex but involves decreased fatty acid synthesis and increased fatty acid oxidation in the liver.

*   **Bempedoic Acid:**
    *   **Mechanism:** This is a newer drug that, like statins, inhibits cholesterol synthesis in the liver. It inhibits ATP-citrate lyase, an enzyme that is upstream of HMG-CoA reductase. The net effect is reduced hepatic cholesterol and upregulation of LDL receptors.

**3. Recognize the efficacy and adverse effects of lipid lowering drugs.**

*   **Statins:**
    *   **Efficacy:** Highly effective. High-intensity statins can lower LDL-C by ≥50%. They also lower triglycerides by ~25%.
    *   **Adverse Effects:** Generally well-tolerated. The most discussed side effect is **statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS)**, which can range from mild myalgia (muscle aches) to, very rarely, severe rhabdomyolysis. A small increase in the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and elevations in liver enzymes can also occur.

*   **Ezetimibe:**
    *   **Efficacy:** Lowers LDL-C by an additional 15-20% when added to a statin.
    *   **Adverse Effects:** Very well-tolerated, with a side effect profile similar to placebo.

*   **PCSK9 Inhibitors:**
    *   **Efficacy:** Very potent, lowering LDL-C by an additional 50-70% on top of statin therapy.
    *   **Adverse Effects:** Generally well-tolerated. The main side effects are injection-site reactions.

*   **Bile Acid Sequestrants:**
    *   **Efficacy:** Modest LDL-C lowering (10-20%).
    *   **Adverse Effects:** Not absorbed systemically, but cause significant gastrointestinal (GI) side effects like constipation and bloating. They can also increase triglyceride levels.

*   **Fibrates:**
    *   **Efficacy:** Primarily lower triglycerides (20-40%).
    *   **Adverse Effects:** Can cause GI upset, and increase the risk of myopathy (especially when used with statins) and gallstones (cholelithiasis).

*   **Omega-3 Fatty Acids (Icosapent Ethyl):**
    *   **Efficacy:** Lower triglycerides by 15-20%. The REDUCE-IT trial showed that icosapent ethyl also reduces ASCVD events in high-risk patients on statins.
    *   **Adverse Effects:** Generally safe. A small increased risk of atrial fibrillation and bleeding has been noted in clinical trials.
