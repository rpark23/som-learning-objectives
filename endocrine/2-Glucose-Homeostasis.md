### Lecture 2: Glucose Homeostasis

**1. Recognize the importance of glucose homeostasis and understand how to diagnose hyperglycemia.**

*   **Importance of Glucose Homeostasis:** The body tightly regulates blood glucose levels to ensure a constant supply of energy to all tissues, especially the brain, which relies almost exclusively on glucose. Both high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) and low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) can have serious short-term and long-term consequences.

*   **Diagnosing Hyperglycemia:**
    *   **Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG):** Measures blood glucose after an overnight fast.
        *   Normal: <100 mg/dL
        *   Prediabetes: 100-125 mg/dL
        *   Diabetes: ≥126 mg/dL
    *   **Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT):** Measures blood glucose before and 2 hours after drinking a glucose-rich drink.
        *   Normal: <140 mg/dL
        *   Prediabetes: 140-199 mg/dL
        *   Diabetes: ≥200 mg/dL
    *   **Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c):** Measures the average blood glucose level over the past 2-3 months by assessing the percentage of hemoglobin that is glycated (coated with sugar).
        *   Normal: <5.7%
        *   Prediabetes: 5.7-6.4%
        *   Diabetes: ≥6.5%
    *   **Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM):** A wearable device that tracks glucose levels in the interstitial fluid continuously, providing real-time data and trends, including "time-in-range" (the percentage of time spent within the target glucose range).

**2. Explain the steps required to secrete insulin.**

Insulin is secreted from the beta-cells of the pancreas in response to high blood glucose levels. The process is as follows:
1.  **Glucose Uptake:** Glucose enters the beta-cell via the GLUT2 transporter.
2.  **Metabolism:** Inside the cell, glucose is metabolized through glycolysis, which increases the intracellular ratio of ATP to ADP.
3.  **KATP Channel Closure:** The high levels of ATP cause the ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels on the cell membrane to close.
4.  **Depolarization:** The closure of potassium channels prevents potassium from leaving the cell, leading to a buildup of positive charge and depolarization of the cell membrane.
5.  **Calcium Influx:** The membrane depolarization causes voltage-gated calcium (Ca2+) channels to open, allowing calcium ions to flow into the cell.
6.  **Insulin Release:** The influx of calcium triggers the fusion of insulin-containing secretory vesicles with the cell membrane and the release of insulin into the bloodstream (a process called **exocytosis**).

**3. Describe the actions of insulin in the liver, adipose tissue, and muscle during feeding and fasting.**

Insulin is an **anabolic** hormone, meaning it promotes the storage of nutrients. Its effects vary depending on the metabolic state (feeding vs. fasting).

*   **During Feeding (High Insulin):**
    *   **Liver:** Insulin stimulates the liver to take up glucose, store it as glycogen (glycogenesis), and use it for energy (glycolysis). It inhibits the production and release of glucose.
    *   **Adipose Tissue:** Insulin promotes glucose uptake via the GLUT4 transporter. This glucose is then used to synthesize fatty acids and glycerol, which are stored as triglycerides (lipogenesis).
    *   **Muscle:** Insulin promotes glucose uptake via the GLUT4 transporter for storage as glycogen and for energy. It also stimulates the uptake of amino acids for protein synthesis.

*   **During Fasting (Low Insulin):**
    *   **Liver:** In the absence of insulin, the liver breaks down glycogen (glycogenolysis) and synthesizes new glucose from other sources like amino acids and glycerol (gluconeogenesis) to maintain blood glucose levels.
    *   **Adipose Tissue:** Low insulin levels lead to the breakdown of stored triglycerides (lipolysis), releasing fatty acids and glycerol into the blood to be used as energy by other tissues.
    *   **Muscle:** With low insulin, muscle glucose uptake is reduced. The muscle can use fatty acids and ketone bodies for energy. During prolonged fasting, muscle protein may be broken down to provide amino acids for gluconeogenesis in the liver.

**4. Describe the actions of glucagon in the liver, adipose tissue, and muscle during feeding and fasting.**

Glucagon is a **catabolic** hormone that counteracts the actions of insulin. It primarily acts on the liver.

*   **During Fasting (High Glucagon):**
    *   **Liver:** Glucagon is the main hormone that signals the liver to maintain blood glucose during fasting. It stimulates glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. It also promotes the production of ketone bodies from fatty acids.
    *   **Adipose Tissue:** Glucagon stimulates lipolysis, the breakdown of triglycerides.
    *   **Muscle:** Muscle cells do not have glucagon receptors, so glucagon has no direct effect on muscle tissue.

*   **During Feeding (Low Glucagon):**
    *   High glucose and insulin levels suppress the release of glucagon, thus inhibiting its catabolic effects.

**5. Recognize that multiple hormones regulate glucose. List hormones that lower glucose and those that increase glucose.**

*   **Hormones that LOWER Glucose:**
    *   **Insulin:** The primary hormone that lowers blood glucose.
    *   **Incretins (GLP-1 and GIP):** Released from the gut in response to food intake, they enhance insulin secretion, suppress glucagon secretion, and slow gastric emptying.
    *   **Amylin:** Co-secreted with insulin, it slows gastric emptying and suppresses glucagon secretion.

*   **Hormones that INCREASE Glucose (Counter-regulatory Hormones):**
    *   **Glucagon:** The primary hormone that raises blood glucose during fasting.
    *   **Epinephrine (Adrenaline):** A fast-acting hormone that promotes glycogenolysis in the liver and muscle.
    *   **Cortisol:** A steroid hormone that promotes gluconeogenesis and decreases glucose uptake in peripheral tissues.
    *   **Growth Hormone:** Can increase blood glucose by decreasing glucose uptake and promoting gluconeogenesis.
