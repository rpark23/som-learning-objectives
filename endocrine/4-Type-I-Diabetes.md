### Lecture 4: Pathogenesis and Treatment of Type 1 Diabetes

**1. Describe the differences between type 1 and type 2 diabetes.**

*   **Type 1 Diabetes (T1D):**
    *   **Pathophysiology:** An **autoimmune** disease where the body's immune system attacks and destroys the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. This results in an absolute insulin deficiency.
    *   **Onset:** Typically presents at a younger age (childhood or adolescence), though it can occur at any age.
    *   **Treatment:** Requires lifelong insulin therapy, as the body cannot produce its own.

*   **Type 2 Diabetes (T2D):**
    *   **Pathophysiology:** Characterized by **insulin resistance**, where the body's cells do not respond effectively to insulin, combined with a **relative insulin deficiency**, where the pancreas cannot produce enough insulin to overcome the resistance.
    *   **Onset:** Typically appears in adulthood, often after puberty, but it is increasingly being diagnosed in younger individuals due to rising rates of obesity.
    *   **Treatment:** Can often be managed initially with lifestyle modifications (diet, exercise), and oral medications. Some individuals may eventually require insulin.

**2. Describe the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes, including immunologic etiology and metabolic consequences.**

*   **Immunologic Etiology:**
    *   **Autoimmunity:** T1D is an autoimmune disorder. The process begins with a genetic predisposition (certain HLA subtypes are major risk factors) combined with one or more environmental triggers (such as viral infections).
    *   **Insulitis:** This combination triggers an autoimmune response against the pancreatic beta cells, leading to inflammation of the islets of Langerhans, a process known as insulitis.
    *   **Autoantibodies:** The immune system produces autoantibodies against various beta-cell proteins (e.g., GADA, IAA, IA-2A, ZnT8A). The presence of these autoantibodies is a key marker of the autoimmune process. About 94% of individuals with newly diagnosed T1D have at least one of these autoantibodies.
    *   **Beta-Cell Destruction:** Over time, the autoimmune attack progressively destroys the beta cells. Symptoms of diabetes do not appear until a large percentage of beta cells (often >80%) have been destroyed.

*   **Stages of T1D:**
    *   **Stage 1:** Presence of autoimmunity (two or more autoantibodies) with normal blood glucose levels (normoglycemia). The individual is presymptomatic.
    *   **Stage 2:** Presence of autoimmunity with abnormal blood glucose levels (dysglycemia), but still without symptoms.
    *   **Stage 3:** The onset of clinical symptoms, such as polyuria, polydipsia, and weight loss, due to significant beta-cell loss and hyperglycemia.

*   **Metabolic Consequences:**
    *   **Absolute Insulin Deficiency:** Without insulin, glucose cannot be taken up and used by most cells for energy.
    *   **Hyperglycemia:** Glucose accumulates in the bloodstream to dangerously high levels.
    *   **Glucagon Excess:** The lack of insulin leads to unchecked glucagon secretion from alpha cells, which further raises blood glucose by stimulating the liver to produce more glucose (gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis).
    *   **Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA):** In the absence of insulin, the body breaks down fat for energy, producing acidic ketone bodies. The overproduction of ketones leads to a state of metabolic acidosis, which is a life-threatening medical emergency.
    *   **Long-Term Complications:** Chronic hyperglycemia damages blood vessels, leading to long-term microvascular (retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy) and macrovascular (cardiovascular disease, peripheral artery disease) complications.

**3. Discuss metabolic issues in the management of DKA.**

Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) is a state of absolute or relative insulin deficiency, leading to severe metabolic derangements. The primary goals of DKA management are to correct these issues:

*   **Correct Acidosis and Reverse Ketosis:** This is the most critical goal. Insulin administration is key, as it inhibits further ketone production and allows the body to start using glucose again, which helps resolve the acidosis.

*   **Correct Dehydration:** Patients with DKA are severely dehydrated due to osmotic diuresis from hyperglycemia. Fluid resuscitation with intravenous (IV) fluids is essential. However, this must be done carefully and slowly (typically over 48 hours) to avoid the risk of cerebral edema, a rare but devastating complication, especially in children.

*   **Replenish Electrolyte Deficits:** The osmotic diuresis also leads to the loss of electrolytes like potassium, sodium, and phosphate. Even if initial blood tests show normal or high potassium levels, patients have a total body potassium deficit. As insulin is administered and the acidosis is corrected, potassium will move back into the cells, and blood levels can drop dangerously low. Therefore, electrolytes must be carefully monitored and replaced.

*   **Restore Glucose to Near Normal:** While hyperglycemia is a feature of DKA, lowering the blood glucose too quickly can be dangerous. The primary focus is on stopping ketone production. Blood glucose levels will naturally fall as the patient is rehydrated and given insulin. Once blood glucose reaches a certain level (e.g., 250-300 mg/dL), dextrose (a form of glucose) is added to the IV fluids to prevent hypoglycemia while the insulin infusion continues to resolve the acidosis.

*   **Identify and Treat Precipitating Factors:** DKA is often triggered by an underlying event, such as an infection, trauma, or missed insulin doses. It is important to identify and treat any such precipitating cause.

**4. Recognize the use of a variety of exogenous insulins to manage patients with type 1 diabetes.**

Since individuals with T1D cannot produce their own insulin, they require lifelong replacement therapy with exogenous (external) insulin. Modern insulin therapy aims to mimic the natural pattern of insulin secretion in a person without diabetes, which consists of two components:

*   **Basal Insulin:** This is a long-acting or intermediate-acting insulin that provides a continuous, low level of insulin to cover the body's background metabolic needs and to keep blood glucose stable between meals and overnight. It is essential even when the person is not eating to prevent DKA.

*   **Bolus Insulin:** This is a rapid-acting or short-acting insulin taken before meals to cover the carbohydrates in the food being eaten (a "carb bolus"). It can also be used to correct a high blood sugar reading (a "correction bolus").

This "basal-bolus" regimen is the standard of care and can be delivered in two main ways:

1.  **Multiple Daily Injections (MDI):** Involves taking one or two injections of basal insulin per day and separate injections of bolus insulin with each meal.
2.  **Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII or Insulin Pump):** Uses a small, computerized device (an insulin pump) to deliver a continuous infusion of rapid-acting insulin to serve as the basal rate. The user then manually directs the pump to deliver a bolus of insulin to cover meals or correct high blood sugars.

Modern diabetes management also heavily relies on technology like **Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs)**, which track glucose levels 24/7, and **Automated Insulin Delivery (AID) or "closed-loop" systems**, where the CGM communicates with the insulin pump to automatically adjust insulin delivery, further improving glycemic control and reducing the burden of care.
