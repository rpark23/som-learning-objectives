### Lecture 11: GH, IGF-1 and Prolactin

**1. Describe the properties of GH-IGF1 and the hypothalamic-pituitary-end organ regulation.**

*   **GH-IGF-1 Axis:** Growth Hormone (GH) is a 191-amino acid protein secreted by the pituitary gland. Its secretion is stimulated by Growth Hormone-Releasing Hormone (GHRH) and ghrelin from the hypothalamus and is inhibited by somatostatin. GH, in turn, stimulates the liver and other tissues to produce Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1).
*   **Feedback Regulation:** The axis is regulated by negative feedback, where both GH and IGF-1 inhibit GHRH release and stimulate somatostatin release, thus down-regulating GH secretion.
*   **Pulsatile Secretion & IGF-1 Binding:** GH is released in pulses, with the highest levels occurring during sleep. In the bloodstream, most IGF-1 is inactive, bound to a large complex of IGF-Binding Protein 3 (IGFBP-3) and the Acid-Labile Subunit (ALS). Only a small fraction is free and biologically active.
*   **Receptor Signaling:** GH binds to a Type 1 cytokine receptor, which activates the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. IGF-1 binds to its own receptor (Type 1 IGF receptor), which is a tyrosine kinase receptor very similar to the insulin receptor.

**2. Describe the metabolic effects of GH and the importance of GH for growth in children.**

*   **Anabolic Effects:** GH is a major anabolic hormone. Many of its effects are mediated by IGF-1, but GH also has direct actions.
*   **Effects on Tissues:**
    *   **Bone:** IGF-1 stimulates the proliferation of chondrocytes in the epiphyseal growth plates, leading to linear bone growth (increase in height) in children.
    *   **Muscle:** Increases muscle mass (anabolic).
    *   **Adipose Tissue:** Has a direct lipolytic effect, breaking down fat and reducing adiposity.
    *   **Other:** Increases protein synthesis in the liver and increases the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in the kidney.
*   **Importance in Children:** GH is the most critical hormone for postnatal linear growth. Its primary role is to ensure children reach their normal adult height.

**3. Describe the consequences of GH excess or deficiency.**

*   **GH Deficiency:**
    *   **In Children:** Leads to growth failure and severe short stature, delayed bone maturation, increased body fat, and a tendency for hypoglycemia in infants.
    *   **In Adults:** Results in a syndrome characterized by decreased bone density, decreased muscle mass, increased abdominal fat, abnormal lipid profiles, reduced aerobic capacity, and poor quality of life.
    *   **Causes:** Can be genetic (e.g., mutations in the GH or GH receptor gene, as in Laron Dwarfism) or acquired (e.g., pituitary tumors, trauma, radiation).
*   **GH Excess:**
    *   **In Children (before growth plates fuse):** Causes **Gigantism**, characterized by extreme height.
    *   **In Adults (after growth plates fuse):** Causes **Acromegaly**, characterized by the insidious and progressive enlargement of hands, feet, and facial features, as well as frontal bossing. It does not cause an increase in height.
    *   **Complications:** Associated with significant co-morbidities, including hypertension, heart disease, diabetes (due to insulin resistance), sleep apnea, and arthritis.

**4. Describe how prolactin secretion is regulated.**

*   **Tonic Inhibition by Dopamine:** Prolactin is unique among anterior pituitary hormones in that its primary control is **inhibitory**. The hypothalamus secretes dopamine, which tonically suppresses prolactin release from lactotroph cells in the pituitary.
*   **Stimulation:** The main physiologic stimulus for prolactin secretion is **suckling** during breastfeeding. Other stimuli include sleep, stress, and meals.
*   **Stalk Interruption:** Any damage to the pituitary stalk (e.g., from trauma or a tumor) can interrupt the flow of dopamine from the hypothalamus, leading to disinhibition and a rise in prolactin levels (hyperprolactinemia).

**5. Describe physiologic and pathologic causes of hyperprolactinemia.**

*   **Physiologic Causes:** Pregnancy, postpartum state, suckling, sleep, stress, physical exertion, and coitus.
*   **Pathologic Causes:**
    *   **Prolactinoma:** A benign tumor of lactotroph cells; the most common cause of pathologic hyperprolactinemia.
    *   **Pituitary Stalk Damage:** As described above.
    *   **Primary Hypothyroidism:** High levels of TRH can weakly stimulate prolactin release.
    *   **Drugs:** Many medications can increase prolactin, most notably antipsychotic drugs that block dopamine receptors.

**6. Describe the clinical features and treatment of prolactinomas.**

*   **Clinical Features:** Excess prolactin suppresses the reproductive axis (by inhibiting GnRH).
    *   **In Women:** Presents with galactorrhea (inappropriate milk production), amenorrhea (loss of periods), and infertility.
    *   **In Men:** Often presents later with larger tumors (macroadenomas), causing headaches, vision changes, or symptoms of low testosterone like decreased libido.
*   **Treatment:** The first-line treatment is medical, using **dopamine agonists** (e.g., cabergoline, bromocriptine). These drugs are highly effective at normalizing prolactin levels and shrinking the tumor, often eliminating the need for surgery.
