### Lecture 3: Normal to Abnormal Glucose Homeostasis

**1. Describe how the body copes with prolonged starvation.**

During prolonged starvation, the body undergoes several metabolic adaptations to conserve energy and maintain essential functions:

*   **Shift in Fuel Source:** The body's primary goal is to provide fuel to the brain. Initially, glycogen stores are used, but these are depleted within about 24 hours. The body then shifts to using stored fat as its main source of energy. Adipose tissue breaks down triglycerides into fatty acids and glycerol. Most tissues can use fatty acids for energy.

*   **Ketone Body Production:** The liver converts fatty acids into ketone bodies (acetoacetate and Î²-hydroxybutyrate). This is a critical adaptation because the brain, which normally relies on glucose, can adapt to use ketone bodies for a significant portion of its energy needs. This process is called ketogenesis.

*   **Protein Sparing:** By using ketone bodies, the brain reduces its demand for glucose. This is crucial for sparing body protein, as muscle would otherwise need to be broken down at a high rate to provide amino acids for gluconeogenesis (the synthesis of new glucose). While some protein is still used, its rate of breakdown is significantly reduced.

*   **Gluconeogenesis:** The liver (and to an increasing extent, the kidneys) continues to produce a small amount of glucose to supply tissues that are obligate glucose users, such as red blood cells.

*   **Hormonal Control:** These changes are orchestrated by a decrease in insulin levels and an increase in glucagon and other counter-regulatory hormones. Low insulin promotes the breakdown of fat (lipolysis) and the production of ketones, while high glucagon stimulates gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis (in the early stages).

**2. Discuss the actions of insulin and glucagon in the liver, adipose tissue, and muscle during starvation.**

*   **Insulin (Low Levels):**
    *   **Liver:** Reduced insulin stimulation allows the liver to switch from glucose storage to glucose production (gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis). It also permits the liver to take up fatty acids and produce ketone bodies.
    *   **Adipose Tissue:** Low insulin levels remove the inhibition on hormone-sensitive lipase, the enzyme that breaks down stored triglycerides. This leads to the release of fatty acids and glycerol into the bloodstream.
    *   **Muscle:** Glucose uptake by muscle (which is insulin-dependent via GLUT4 transporters) is significantly reduced. Muscle protein breakdown is increased (though spared as much as possible) to release amino acids for gluconeogenesis.

*   **Glucagon (High Levels):**
    *   **Liver:** Glucagon is the primary signal for the liver to increase glucose output. It strongly stimulates both glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis.
    *   **Adipose Tissue:** Glucagon promotes lipolysis, contributing to the release of fatty acids.
    *   **Muscle:** Muscle cells lack glucagon receptors, so glucagon has no direct effect on muscle tissue.

**3. Understand the clinical and laboratory changes that occur in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a severe metabolic complication of insulin deficiency.**

DKA is a life-threatening emergency caused by a profound lack of insulin.

*   **Clinical Changes:**
    *   **Hyperglycemia:** Leads to polyuria (excessive urination) and polydipsia (excessive thirst) as the kidneys try to excrete the excess glucose, pulling water with it (osmotic diuresis). This causes severe dehydration and volume depletion, leading to tachycardia (rapid heart rate).
    *   **Ketoacidosis:** The overproduction of ketone bodies (which are acidic) overwhelms the body's buffering capacity, leading to metabolic acidosis. This causes:
        *   Nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.
        *   A characteristic "fruity" odor on the breath from the exhalation of acetone (a type of ketone).
        *   Kussmaul breathing: deep, rapid respirations as the body tries to compensate for the acidosis by blowing off carbon dioxide.
    *   **Mental Status Changes:** Dehydration, acidosis, and hyperosmolality can lead to confusion, drowsiness, and eventually coma.

*   **Laboratory Changes:**
    *   **Blood Glucose:** Markedly elevated (e.g., > 250 mg/dL).
    *   **Arterial pH:** Low (< 7.3), indicating acidosis.
    *   **Serum Bicarbonate:** Low (< 18 mEq/L), as it is consumed in an attempt to buffer the excess acid.
    *   **Ketones:** High levels in both the blood (ketonemia) and urine (ketonuria).
    *   **Anion Gap:** An elevated anion gap `[Na+ - (Cl- + HCO3-)]` is a hallmark of DKA, reflecting the presence of unmeasured anions (the ketone bodies).
    *   **Serum Osmolality:** Increased due to the high concentration of glucose in the blood.

**4. Recognize the similarities and differences between starvation and DKA.**

*   **Similarities:**
    *   Both are states of low insulin and high glucagon.
    *   In both states, the body utilizes fat for energy, leading to the production of ketone bodies.
    *   Both involve increased gluconeogenesis and lipolysis.

*   **Differences:**
    *   **Degree of Insulin Deficiency:** Starvation involves low insulin levels, but there is still enough insulin present to suppress ketogenesis to a degree and prevent runaway acidosis. DKA is characterized by a severe or absolute lack of insulin, leading to uncontrolled ketone production.
    *   **Blood Glucose Level:** In starvation, blood glucose is maintained in the low-normal range. In DKA, there is severe hyperglycemia because tissues cannot take up glucose without insulin.
    *   **Severity of Ketosis:** Ketosis is mild to moderate in starvation and is a physiological adaptation. In DKA, ketosis is severe and pathological, leading to life-threatening acidosis.
    *   **Hydration Status:** While some dehydration can occur in starvation, DKA involves profound dehydration and volume depletion due to osmotic diuresis caused by extreme hyperglycemia.
    *   **Overall State:** Starvation is a physiological adaptation to a lack of food. DKA is a decompensated, pathological state that requires immediate medical intervention.
