### Lecture 13: Endocrinology of Growth

**1. Describe the tempo of normal growth and puberty, the hormones regulating growth and the factors to consider if growth is too slow or too fast.**

*   **Tempo of Growth:** Growth is fastest in the first year of life (~25 cm/yr), slows during childhood (~5-8 cm/yr), and then accelerates again during the pubertal growth spurt. Growth velocity is a key parameter; crossing percentiles on the growth chart after age 2 suggests abnormal growth.
*   **Hormones Regulating Growth:**
    *   **Fetal Growth:** Primarily driven by maternal factors, the placenta, and fetal hormones, especially **Insulin-like Growth Factors (IGFs)** and **Insulin**. Growth hormone (GH) is not essential for fetal growth.
    *   **Childhood Growth:** Primarily driven by **GH** and **Thyroid Hormone**. Glucocorticoids in excess will inhibit growth.
    *   **Pubertal Growth:** Driven by the synergistic action of **GH** and **sex steroids** (testosterone/estrogen), which cause the pubertal growth spurt.
*   **Factors to Consider:** Growth patterns vary by genetics, family, and ethnicity. A systematic evaluation including history (birth weight, parental heights, timing of puberty, illness) and physical exam (height, weight, growth trends, pubertal stage) is essential.

**2. Distinguish normal variant growth patterns from the endocrine disorders.**

*   **Normal Variants (Most Common Causes of Short Stature):**
    *   **Familial (Genetic) Short Stature:** The child is short, but their growth velocity is normal, and their height is appropriate for their short parents. They will be short as an adult.
    *   **Constitutional Delay of Growth and Puberty ("Late Bloomer"):** The child has delayed growth and puberty, often with a family history of the same. Their bone age is delayed, and they will have a normal adult height, just achieved later.
*   **Endocrine Disorders Causing Short Stature:**
    *   **Hypothyroidism:** Causes a slowing of growth. Often associated with weight gain.
    *   **Growth Hormone Deficiency:** Leads to poor growth velocity with preserved weight. Results in proportionate short stature.
    *   **Glucocorticoid Excess (Cushing's Syndrome):** Causes growth failure, typically with significant weight gain.
    *   **Precocious Puberty:** Causes an initial growth spurt, but the early fusion of growth plates leads to a short adult stature if untreated.
*   **Non-Endocrine Causes of Short Stature:** Include genetic/chromosomal disorders (e.g., Turner Syndrome, Achondroplasia), intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), and chronic systemic illnesses.
*   **Tall Stature:** Can be familial or due to syndromes (e.g., Marfan, Klinefelter). Accelerated growth suggests conditions like exogenous obesity, precocious puberty, or hyperthyroidism.

**3. Understand which lab studies might be used to distinguish different growth disorders.**

*   **Initial Evaluation:** A thorough history and physical exam are paramount and guide the laboratory evaluation.
*   **Endocrine Labs:**
    *   **T4 and TSH:** To screen for hypothyroidism.
    *   **IGF-1 and IGFBP-3:** To screen for GH deficiency (low levels) or excess (high levels).
    *   **Sex Steroids (LH, FSH, Estradiol/Testosterone):** To evaluate for precocious or delayed puberty.
    *   **Cortisol:** Rarely, to evaluate for Cushing's syndrome.
*   **Non-Endocrine Labs:**
    *   **CBC, ESR:** To screen for chronic illness or inflammation.
    *   **Celiac Screen:** Celiac disease can present solely as poor growth.
    *   **Renal and Hepatic Function tests.**
    *   **Karyotype:** To evaluate for chromosomal disorders like Turner Syndrome (in a girl with unexplained short stature).
