### Lecture 10: Neuroendocrinology

**1. Describe the structure of the anterior pituitary; cell types; principal hormones; relationship of anterior pituitary hormones to releasing or inhibiting factors from hypothalamus.**

*   **Structure and Location:** The pituitary gland is located in the sella turcica, a bony depression at the base of the skull. It is anatomically and functionally connected to the hypothalamus by the pituitary stalk (infundibulum). The anterior pituitary (adenohypophysis) is distinct from the posterior pituitary (neurohypophysis). A critical feature is the **hypothalamic-hypophyseal portal circulation**, a specialized network of capillaries and portal veins that transports hormones from the hypothalamus directly to the anterior pituitary.

*   **Cell Types and Principal Hormones:** The anterior pituitary contains several distinct cell types that produce specific hormones:
    *   **Somatotrophs:** Produce Growth Hormone (GH). (Most abundant cell type, ~50%).
    *   **Lactotrophs:** Produce Prolactin (PRL). (~10-30%).
    *   **Corticotrophs:** Produce Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH). (~10-30%).
    *   **Thyrotrophs:** Produce Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH). (~5%).
    *   **Gonadotrophs:** Produce Luteinizing Hormone (LH) and Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH).

*   **Relationship with Hypothalamus:** The secretion of these anterior pituitary hormones is controlled by releasing and inhibiting hormones produced in the hypothalamus. These hypothalamic hormones travel through the portal circulation to act on the pituitary cells.
    *   **Stimulatory Hormones:**
        *   **GnRH** (Gonadotropin-releasing hormone) → stimulates LH and FSH release.
        *   **TRH** (Thyrotropin-releasing hormone) → stimulates TSH and prolactin release.
        *   **CRH** (Corticotropin-releasing hormone) → stimulates ACTH release.
        *   **GHRH** (Growth hormone-releasing hormone) → stimulates GH release.
    *   **Inhibitory Hormones:**
        *   **Somatostatin** → inhibits GH and TSH release.
        *   **Dopamine** → inhibits prolactin release.

**2. Discuss negative and positive feedback and short-and long-term feedback loops.**

Feedback loops are the primary mechanism for regulating the hypothalamic-pituitary axis.

*   **Negative Feedback:** This is the most common type. Hormones from the peripheral endocrine glands (e.g., cortisol, thyroid hormone, testosterone/estrogen) circulate back to the pituitary and hypothalamus to inhibit the secretion of their stimulating hormones. This maintains homeostasis and prevents hormone overproduction.
    *   **Long-loop feedback:** The final peripheral hormone (e.g., cortisol) inhibits the hypothalamus (CRH) and pituitary (ACTH).
    *   **Short-loop feedback:** A pituitary hormone (e.g., ACTH) inhibits the hypothalamus (CRH).

*   **Positive Feedback:** This is much rarer. A hormone stimulates its own secretion or the secretion of its upstream hormones. The primary example is the surge of estrogen during the menstrual cycle, which stimulates a surge in LH from the pituitary, leading to ovulation.

**3. Explain what is meant by an endocrine rhythm and be able to describe the diurnal variation of at least one endocrine hormone and state when this rhythm is disrupted.**

*   **Endocrine Rhythm:** Hormones are not secreted at a constant rate but are released in rhythms or pulses. A **circadian rhythm** is an endogenous rhythm that follows a roughly 24-hour cycle.

*   **Diurnal Variation of Cortisol:** Cortisol provides a classic example of a diurnal (daily) rhythm. ACTH and cortisol levels are highest in the early morning, shortly before waking, and decline throughout the day to their lowest point in the late evening. This rhythm is crucial for glucose homeostasis and preparing the body for the activity of the day.

*   **Disruption of Rhythm:** This normal rhythm can be disrupted by several factors:
    *   **Stress:** Physical or psychological stress can override the normal circadian rhythm, causing cortisol levels to rise at any time of day.
    *   **Disease:** In conditions like Cushing's syndrome (cortisol excess) or depression, the diurnal rhythm is lost, and cortisol levels remain high throughout the day and night.
    *   **Sleep-Wake Cycle Changes:** Altering sleep schedules (e.g., shift work) can disrupt the cortisol rhythm.

**4. Describe the consequences of pituitary tumors synthesizing excess or insufficient hormone(s).**

Pituitary tumors (adenomas) are a common cause of pituitary hormone dysfunction. They are classified as functioning (hormone-secreting) or non-functioning.

*   **Excess Hormone Secretion (Functioning Adenomas):**
    *   The tumor produces a specific hormone in an unregulated, excessive manner, leading to a clinical syndrome. The normal negative feedback mechanisms are disrupted.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   **Prolactinoma (Lactotroph adenoma):** The most common type. Excess prolactin causes amenorrhea, galactorrhea, and infertility in women, and decreased libido and erectile dysfunction in men.
        *   **Cushing's Disease (Corticotroph adenoma):** Excess ACTH stimulates the adrenal glands to produce excess cortisol, leading to Cushing's syndrome (weight gain, easy bruising, hypertension, etc.).
        *   **Acromegaly/Gigantism (Somatotroph adenoma):** Excess GH causes gigantism in children (before growth plates close) and acromegaly in adults (enlargement of hands, feet, and facial features).

*   **Insufficient Hormone Secretion (Hypopituitarism):**
    *   This can be caused by a large non-functioning adenoma that compresses and destroys the normal pituitary tissue, or by surgery or radiation used to treat a tumor.
    *   The result is a deficiency of one or more pituitary hormones, leading to secondary end-organ failure.

*   **Mass Effect:** Regardless of whether they are functioning or non-functioning, large pituitary tumors can compress surrounding structures, most notably the **optic chiasm**, which sits directly above the pituitary. This compression can cause visual field defects, classically a **bitemporal hemianopsia** (loss of peripheral vision).

**5. Distinguish primary versus secondary end-organ failure.**

This distinction is crucial for diagnosing endocrine disorders.

*   **Primary End-Organ Failure:**
    *   **Problem:** The peripheral endocrine gland itself is damaged or dysfunctional and cannot produce its hormone (e.g., the adrenal gland fails in Addison's disease; the ovary fails in menopause).
    *   **Hormone Levels:** The peripheral hormone level is **low**, and because of the loss of negative feedback, the pituitary stimulating hormone level is **high** (e.g., low cortisol, high ACTH; low estrogen, high FSH).

*   **Secondary End-Organ Failure:**
    *   **Problem:** The pituitary gland is the problem. It fails to produce its stimulating hormone, so the (otherwise healthy) peripheral gland is not stimulated.
    *   **Hormone Levels:** Both the pituitary stimulating hormone and the peripheral hormone levels are **low** (e.g., low ACTH, low cortisol; low FSH, low estrogen).

**6. Understand pulsatile vs. continuous GnRH as an illustration of the importance of hormone pattern to biological effect.**

This principle is best illustrated by the regulation of gonadotropins (LH and FSH).

*   **Pulsatile GnRH Secretion:** The hypothalamus normally releases GnRH in a **pulsatile** fashion (i.e., in bursts). This pulsatile pattern is essential for stimulating the gonadotroph cells in the pituitary to produce and release LH and FSH, which in turn drives normal reproductive function (e.g., puberty, menstrual cycle).

*   **Continuous GnRH Administration:** If GnRH is given **continuously** (non-physiologically), it leads to the downregulation and desensitization of GnRH receptors on the pituitary gonadotrophs. This paradoxically **inhibits** the release of LH and FSH, effectively shutting down the reproductive axis.

*   **Clinical Application:** This phenomenon is used therapeutically. Continuous-acting GnRH agonists (like leuprolide) are used to create a state of "biochemical castration" to treat hormone-sensitive conditions like prostate cancer, breast cancer, and endometriosis, or to suppress puberty in cases of precocious puberty.
