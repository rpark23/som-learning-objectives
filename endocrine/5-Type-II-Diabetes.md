### Lecture 5: Type 2 Diabetes

**1. Understand the epidemiology and classification of type 2 diabetes in adults.**

*   **Epidemiology:**
    *   **Prevalence:** Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) is a major global health issue. In the US, over 11% of the population has diabetes, with T2D accounting for about 95% of all cases. Including prediabetes, over 50% of US adults are affected. A significant portion of these individuals, especially those with prediabetes, are unaware of their condition.
    *   **Trends:** The prevalence of T2D is increasing worldwide, driven by factors like the aging population, urbanization, obesity, and sedentary lifestyles. It is also being diagnosed at increasingly younger ages, including in adolescents and children.
    *   **Disparities:** There are significant disparities in prevalence based on race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. In the US, prevalence is higher in Black, Hispanic, Asian American, and Native American populations compared to non-Hispanic white populations. Lower levels of education are also associated with a higher prevalence.

*   **Classification & Diagnosis:**
    *   **Classification:** T2D is characterized by a combination of insulin resistance and a relative (not absolute) deficiency in insulin secretion. It is distinct from Type 1 Diabetes (autoimmune destruction of beta-cells) and other forms like gestational diabetes or monogenic diabetes (e.g., MODY).
    *   **Diagnostic Criteria:** Diagnosis is made based on blood glucose measurements. The same criteria are used for both T1D and T2D, and one of the following must be met:
        *   **Fasting Plasma Glucose:** ≥ 126 mg/dL
        *   **2-hour Plasma Glucose (during an OGTT):** ≥ 200 mg/dL
        *   **Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c):** ≥ 6.5%
        *   **Random Plasma Glucose:** ≥ 200 mg/dL in a patient with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia.
    *   **Prediabetes:** This is a high-risk state for developing T2D, defined by glucose levels that are higher than normal but not yet high enough for a diabetes diagnosis (e.g., Impaired Fasting Glucose, Impaired Glucose Tolerance).

**2. Understand the pathophysiology of insulin resistance and hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes.**

The pathophysiology of T2D is complex and multifactorial, involving genetic predisposition and environmental factors (especially obesity and physical inactivity). The core defects are:

*   **Insulin Resistance:**
    *   This is the primary defect. The body's main insulin-sensitive tissues—muscle, fat (adipose tissue), and liver—do not respond effectively to normal levels of insulin.
    *   **Muscle:** Decreased glucose uptake from the blood.
    *   **Adipose Tissue:** Impaired suppression of lipolysis (fat breakdown), leading to an increased release of free fatty acids (FFAs) into the circulation.
    *   **Liver:** The liver does not properly suppress its glucose production, leading to excess glucose being released into the blood, especially during the fasting state.
    *   **Mechanism:** At the cellular level, insulin resistance is a post-receptor defect. High levels of FFAs and inflammatory signals can trigger intracellular pathways (involving kinases like IKKβ and JNK1) that phosphorylate the insulin receptor substrate (IRS-1) on serine/threonine residues. This prevents the normal tyrosine phosphorylation required to activate the downstream signaling pathway (PI3-kinase), ultimately blocking the translocation of GLUT4 glucose transporters to the cell surface and impairing glucose uptake.

*   **Beta-Cell Dysfunction:**
    *   Initially, the pancreatic beta-cells compensate for insulin resistance by producing more insulin (compensatory hyperinsulinemia). For a time, this keeps blood glucose levels normal.
    *   Over time, the beta-cells begin to fail. They cannot sustain the high level of insulin production needed to overcome the resistance. This leads to a relative deficiency in insulin secretion.
    *   The combination of persistent insulin resistance and declining insulin secretion results in hyperglycemia.

*   **Role of Incretin Hormones:**
    *   Incretin hormones, like GLP-1, are released from the gut after a meal and normally enhance insulin secretion. In T2D, the incretin effect is diminished. GLP-1 secretion is reduced, and the beta-cells may have a reduced response to GIP, contributing to impaired meal-time insulin release.

*   **Glucagon Dysregulation:**
    *   In T2D, glucagon levels often remain high even after a meal, when they should be suppressed. This inappropriate glucagon secretion further contributes to hyperglycemia by stimulating hepatic glucose production.

**3. Know the complications of type 2 diabetes.**

Chronic hyperglycemia is toxic to blood vessels and leads to long-term complications, which are the major cause of morbidity and mortality in T2D.

*   **Microvascular Complications (damage to small blood vessels):**
    *   **Retinopathy:** Damage to the blood vessels of the retina, a leading cause of blindness.
    *   **Nephropathy:** Damage to the kidneys, which can progress to kidney failure and the need for dialysis.
    *   **Neuropathy:** Nerve damage, most commonly causing a "stocking and glove" pattern of numbness, tingling, and pain in the feet and hands (peripheral neuropathy). It can also affect autonomic nerves.

*   **Macrovascular Complications (damage to large blood vessels - atherosclerosis):**
    *   **Cardiovascular Disease (CVD):** This is the #1 cause of death in people with T2D. It includes:
        *   **Myocardial Infarction (Heart Attack)**
        *   **Ischemic Stroke**
        *   **Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD):** Reduced blood flow to the limbs, which can lead to pain, non-healing ulcers, and amputations.

**4. Be familiar with current treatment guidelines for type 2 diabetes.**

Treatment for T2D is comprehensive and focuses on both glycemic control and cardiovascular risk reduction.

*   **Lifestyle Management:** This is the foundation of T2D care and includes:
    *   **Weight Loss:** A moderate weight loss of 5-10% of body weight can significantly improve glycemic control.
    *   **Exercise:** At least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week.
    *   **Medical Nutrition Therapy:** A healthy eating plan tailored to the individual.

*   **Glycemic Control:**
    *   **HbA1c Goal:** The general goal is an HbA1c < 7%. More stringent goals (e.g., <6.5%) may be appropriate for younger, healthier patients, while less stringent goals may be better for older adults with multiple comorbidities.
    *   **Pharmacotherapy:** If lifestyle changes are not enough, medications are added. Metformin is typically the first-line agent. Numerous other classes of medications are available, and the choice depends on factors like cardiovascular and kidney disease status, efficacy, side effects, and cost.

*   **Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Risk Factor Management:** This is a critical component of care.
    *   **Blood Pressure Control:** Goal is typically <140/90 mmHg, or <130/80 mmHg in individuals with known nephropathy or at high CVD risk.
    *   **Statin Therapy:** Moderate or high-intensity statin therapy is recommended for most adults with T2D to manage cholesterol levels, based on age and ASCVD risk.
    *   **Aspirin:** Low-dose aspirin may be considered for primary or secondary prevention of CVD in certain individuals.
