### Lecture 14: Metabolic Bone Physiology

**1. Understand how calcium levels are regulated and how dysregulation can occur.**

Calcium homeostasis is governed by the interplay of the **calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR)**, **parathyroid hormone (PTH)**, the **kidney**, **intestine**, and **bone**. The CaSR in the parathyroid and kidney acts as a “calcium thermostat.” When serum calcium falls, CaSR signaling drops and **PTH** secretion rises. PTH:
- In the **kidney**: increases distal tubular calcium reabsorption and stimulates 1α-hydroxylase to produce **1,25(OH)2-D (calcitriol)**.
- In the **intestine**: indirectly (via calcitriol) increases calcium absorption.
- In **bone**: together with calcitriol, increases bone turnover with a net increase in resorption, releasing calcium and phosphorus.

Serum calcium is tightly regulated with a sigmoid **PTH–calcium response curve**. Because ~50% of serum calcium is protein-bound, adjust total calcium for albumin: Ca corrected (mg/dL) = 0.8 × (4.0 – albumin [g/dL]) + measured Ca. Measuring **ionized calcium** is helpful when protein binding is altered.

Dysregulation:
- **Hypercalcemia**: 
  - PTH-dependent (e.g., **primary hyperparathyroidism**: high Ca, high PTH, high urine Ca; **FHH**: CaSR loss-of-function; high Ca, high/normal PTH, low urine Ca; very rare: parathyroid carcinoma; **tertiary hyperparathyroidism** in CKD).
  - PTH-independent (e.g., **malignancy** via osteolysis, **PTHrP**, or excess calcitriol; **granulomatous disease** with unregulated 1α-hydroxylase; vitamin D toxicity; milk-alkali; medications). Phosphorus helps differentiate causes: PTH-mediated hypercalcemia tends to have low phosphorus; calcitriol-mediated causes often have high/normal-high phosphorus.
- **Hypocalcemia**:
  - Low PTH (postsurgical hypoparathyroidism, destructive/autoimmune, congenital).
  - High PTH (severe **vitamin D deficiency/resistance**, **chronic kidney disease** with loss of 1α-hydroxylase, **pseudohypoparathyroidism** with renal PTH resistance).
  - Other contributors: citrate load from transfusions, sepsis, high phosphorus with extravascular calcium deposition, antiresorptives/calcimimetics.

Clinical signs include **Chvostek’s** and **Trousseau’s** signs in hypocalcemia; severe cases can cause seizures and QT prolongation.

**2. Understand how phosphate levels are regulated and how dysregulation can occur.**

Phosphorus (as inorganic **phosphate, Pi**) is mostly in **bone (~85%)**, with small extracellular stores (~0.2%). Intestinal absorption is both **active** (via **NaPi2b**, stimulated by calcitriol) and **passive**. The kidney filters large phosphate loads and reabsorbs most in the **proximal tubule** through **NaPi2a/NaPi2c**.

Key regulators:
- **PTH**: decreases proximal tubular phosphate reabsorption (promotes phosphaturia) while increasing renal calcium reabsorption and calcitriol production.
- **FGF23** (from osteocytes): increases phosphate excretion and suppresses 1α-hydroxylase, reducing **1,25(OH)2-D**.
- Rising serum phosphorus increases **PTH** and **FGF23** and suppresses calcitriol.

Dysregulation:
- **Hyperphosphatemia**: common in **kidney disease** due to impaired excretion; compensatory **FGF23** rises early but becomes insufficient as renal function declines.
- **Hypophosphatemia**: due to malabsorption, intracellular shifts, or renal phosphate wasting. Excess **FGF23** causes renal phosphate wasting and low calcitriol (e.g., genetic hypophosphatemic rickets; **tumor-induced osteomalacia**). Rare transporter defects (e.g., **HHRH** from NaPi2c mutations) cause hypophosphatemia with hypercalciuria.

**3. Understand the metabolism and actions of vitamin D and how dysregulation can occur.**

Vitamin D comes from skin **UVB**-driven synthesis of **cholecalciferol (D3)** and from dietary **D2/D3**. In the **liver**, vitamin D is converted to **25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]** (storage form; measured to assess status). In the **kidney**, 1α-hydroxylase converts 25(OH)D to active **1,25(OH)2-D (calcitriol)**, regulated by:
- Stimulators: **PTH**, low ionized calcium.
- Inhibitors: **FGF23**, high phosphorus.

Actions of calcitriol:
- Increases **intestinal absorption** of calcium and phosphate.
- At higher levels, increases **bone resorption**.
- Signals via the nuclear **vitamin D receptor (VDR)**, a DNA-binding transcription factor that interacts with RXR to regulate gene transcription. Catabolism via **24-hydroxylase** provides counter-regulation.

Dysregulation:
- Excess calcitriol (e.g., in **granulomatous disease** or **lymphoma** with unregulated 1α-hydroxylase) causes hypercalcemia and tends to raise phosphorus.
- Extremely high **25(OH)D** from over-supplementation can cause hypercalcemia.
- Severe **liver failure** can impair 25-hydroxylation; **CKD** impairs 1α-hydroxylation.
- **VDR mutations** lead to end-organ resistance: low calcium, high PTH, high 1,25(OH)2-D.

**4. Identify extracellular and cellular components of bone.**

Bone is a dynamic organ with structural and metabolic roles. It comprises:
- Extracellular matrix:
  - **Organic**: ~90% **type I collagen** forming a triple helix scaffold; non-collagen proteins (e.g., **osteocalcin**) regulate mineralization and add strength.
  - **Inorganic**: **hydroxyapatite** crystals (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2) that mineralize the collagen matrix, conferring stiffness.
- Cellular elements:
  - **Osteoblasts** (mesenchymal lineage): synthesize type I collagen and form osteoid; many undergo apoptosis, some become surface **lining cells** or embed as **osteocytes**.
  - **Osteocytes**: embedded osteoblast descendants acting as **mechanosensors**; they coordinate remodeling and secrete **RANKL** (promotes osteoclasts) and **sclerostin** (inhibits Wnt-mediated formation).
  - **Osteoclasts** (hematopoietic lineage): multinucleated cells that resorb bone by sealing to the surface and secreting acid and proteases.

Macro-architecture:
- **Cortical bone** (dense shell; ~80% of mass, ~20% of turnover) arranged in **osteons**.
- **Trabecular bone** (spongy interior; high surface area; major site of turnover).

Pathology example: **Osteogenesis imperfecta** results from mutations in type I collagen α-chains, causing fragile bone; antiresorptives and anabolic therapies can improve density and reduce fractures.

**5. Understand the roles of osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and osteocytes.**

- **Osteoblasts**: derive from mesenchymal stem cells; differentiate under lineage factors (e.g., **Runx2**, Osx), produce collagenous matrix, and orchestrate formation. A subset becomes **lining cells** or **osteocytes**.
- **Osteoclasts**: arise from monocyte/macrophage lineage; form a ruffled border and acidic resorption lacuna to dissolve mineral and matrix.
- **Osteocytes**: master regulators; sense mechanical strain and damage, guide osteoclasts to resorb old/damaged bone, and secrete **RANKL** and **sclerostin** to couple resorption and formation.

Bone remodeling occurs in **bone multicellular units (BMUs)** cycling through:
1) **Resorption** (≈2 weeks) by osteoclasts,
2) **Reversal** (≈4–5 weeks) preparing the surface,
3) **Formation** (up to ≈4 months) by osteoblasts, followed by mineralization that can take months to years.

**6. Describe the roles of two important systems regulating bone remodeling: the RANKL system and Wnt signaling.**

- **RANKL/OPG system**:
  - **RANKL** (produced largely by **osteocytes**, also osteoblasts) is cleaved to a soluble ligand that binds **RANK** on osteoclast precursors, driving their differentiation and activation, thereby increasing **bone resorption**.
  - **Osteoprotegerin (OPG)**, secreted by osteoblasts, is a soluble decoy receptor that binds **RANKL** and limits osteoclastogenesis, helping couple resorption to subsequent formation.

- **Wnt signaling**:
  - Osteogenic **Wnt ligands** bind **LRP5/6** and **Frizzled**, stabilize **β-catenin**, and induce transcription of osteoanabolic genes—promoting **bone formation**, maintaining mesenchymal progenitors, and influencing both osteoblasts and osteoclasts.
  - **Sclerostin**, secreted by **osteocytes**, binds LRP5/6 and inhibits Wnt signaling, reducing formation. With mechanical loading, osteocytes lower **sclerostin**, permitting Wnt activation and enhanced formation.
  - Clinical relevance: anti-**sclerostin** therapy increases bone formation (osteoporosis treatment); inactivating sclerostin mutations cause very high bone mass (sclerosteosis, Van Buchem’s disease).

These two systems integrate mechanical and hormonal cues to couple **bone resorption** and **formation**, preserving skeletal strength while allowing mineral homeostasis.
