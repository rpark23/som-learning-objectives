### Lecture: Thyroid Pathology

**1. Describe the common benign causes of thyroid enlargement.**

The most common benign causes of enlargement in this lecture are **multinodular goiter** and **follicular adenoma**.

- **Multinodular goiter (thyroid follicular nodular disease):**
  - Definition: A **chronically enlarged thyroid** not due to a neoplasm, caused by repeated cycles of **hyperplasia and involution** in response to intermittent **TSH stimulation** (influenced by dietary goitrogens and hormonal alterations).
  - Epidemiology: The **most common** cause of clinically significant thyroid enlargement in the U.S.
  - Gross features: **Asymmetric** gland with **multiple nodules** of varying sizes and textures; cut surfaces often **heterogeneous**, with **colloid-rich** tan gelatinous areas and **degenerative changes** (hemorrhage, cystic change, fibrosis, calcification).
  - Clinical: Usually painless; can cause pressure symptoms or tracheal deviation when large. Rarely, a carcinoma can arise within a multinodular goiter.
- **Follicular adenoma:**
  - Definition: The **most common benign thyroid neoplasm**; a clonal, noninvasive neoplasm that forms a **solitary**, **well-circumscribed/encapsulated nodule**.
  - Microscopy: Distinctive, repetitive patterns (**microfollicular**, **trabecular**, **solid**, or **oncocytic/Hürthle cell**) with an **absence of nuclear atypia**.
  - Clinical: Often **nonfunctional** and discovered incidentally or due to local symptoms (globus sensation, compression, cosmetic change). Importantly, it is **not a precursor** to follicular carcinoma.

(Other benign causes of diffuse enlargement exist—e.g., autoimmune or inflammatory thyroiditis and Graves’ disease—but they are not the focus of this session.)

**2. Identify the major types of thyroid carcinoma and differentiate the key pathologic features of each type.**

The four major types are:

- **Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) — ~85%**
  - Origin/grade: **Well-differentiated** carcinoma of follicular epithelial origin with **distinctive nuclear features**.
  - Key microscopic features: **Nuclear clearing (“Orphan Annie” nuclei)**, **nuclear grooves**, **intranuclear pseudoinclusions**; **psammoma bodies** may be present. Papillary architecture is common but **not required**.
  - Clinical: Presents as a **solitary nodule** or **cervical lymphadenopathy**; risk factor is **childhood radiation exposure**.
  - Spread: Predominantly via **lymphatics** to **regional lymph nodes**.
  - Molecular: **BRAF V600E** associated with classical and more aggressive variants (infiltrative growth, higher nodal recurrence); **RAS** more often in less aggressive follicular variants (more expansile growth, radioiodine-avid).
  - Prognosis/management: **>95% 10-year survival**; worse with **age >40**, **extrathyroidal extension**, or **distant metastases**. Managed with **thyroidectomy ± lymph node dissection**, **TSH suppression**, **I-131 ablation** as indicated, and **thyroglobulin** monitoring.

- **Follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) — 5–15%**
  - Definition: **Well-differentiated** carcinoma of follicular cells defined by **invasive growth** with **no PTC-type nuclear features**.
  - Diagnostic criteria: **Capsular invasion** and/or **vascular invasion** are required (e.g., “mushrooming” through the capsule; polypoid tumor plugs in vessels with fibrin).
  - Spread: **Hematogenous** dissemination to **lung** and **bone**.
  - Molecular: Often **RAS mutations** or **PAX8-PPARG** fusion.
  - Prognostic patterns:
    - **Minimally invasive** (capsular invasion only): very low mortality.
    - **Encapsulated angioinvasive**: risk relates to extent of vascular invasion.
    - **Widely invasive**: high metastatic risk; ~50% 10-year mortality.
  - Management parallels PTC for well-differentiated tumors (surgery, TSH suppression, radioiodine when appropriate).

- **Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma — <5%**
  - Biology: **Undifferentiated**, highly aggressive tumor derived from follicular epithelial cells with **loss of epithelial differentiation**.
  - Clinical: Occurs in **older patients**; rapidly enlarging **neck mass** with **hoarseness**, **dysphagia**, **vocal cord paralysis**, **dyspnea**; often **unresectable** at diagnosis.
  - Pathology: **Large fleshy masses** with **hemorrhage/necrosis**; microscopically **spindled, pleomorphic, squamoid, rhabdoid** patterns with marked atypia; no recognizable thyroid structures.
  - Course/treatment: **Dismal prognosis** (death often <1 year); frequent **distant metastases**; management includes **airway/stabilization**, surgery if possible, **external beam radiation**, **systemic therapy**; a subset with **BRAF V600E** may respond to targeted therapy.

- **Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) — ~5%**
  - Cell of origin: **Parafollicular C cells (neuroendocrine)**.
  - Markers/pathology: Produces **calcitonin** (serum/tissue marker); **amyloid** deposits in tumor stroma (derived from calcitonin) in ~80–85%.
  - Genetics:
    - **Sporadic (70–80%)**: usually **solitary**, peak age **40–60**.
    - **Heritable (20–30%)**: **germline RET** mutations; associated with **MEN 2A/2B** and **FMTC**; often **bilateral/multifocal** with **C-cell hyperplasia** as a precursor; autosomal dominant.
  - Spread/prognosis: Metastasizes to **lymph nodes**, **liver**, **lungs**, **bone**; survival varies by stage (localized >95% 5–10 yr; distant ~50% 5–10 yr).
  - Management: **Total thyroidectomy**; in inherited forms, **prophylactic thyroidectomy** based on mutation risk and **calcitonin** levels.

**3. Summarize the role of ultrasound and fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNA) in reaching a diagnosis for thyroid nodules.**

- **Initial step: assess function**
  - Check **TSH**. If **low TSH** with a **“hot” nodule** on radioiodine scan, malignancy is **exceedingly rare** and **biopsy is not indicated**.
- **Diagnostic ultrasound (US)**
  - Best first imaging test for a **nonfunctioning (normal TSH)** nodule.
  - Evaluates **sonographic features** of the nodule and **background thyroid**, and assesses **cervical lymph nodes**.
  - Provides **risk stratification** and determines **need for FNA** based on **size** and **suspicion** (typically >1–2 cm depending on risk pattern).
- **Fine-needle aspiration (FNA)**
  - A **minimally invasive**, US-guided biopsy that samples **follicular cells** and **colloid** for **cytology**.
  - Strengths: Accurately diagnoses **papillary carcinoma** (via nuclear features), **benign colloid nodules**, **medullary carcinoma** (with calcitonin IHC/serum), and **Hashimoto thyroiditis**.
  - Limitation: Cannot distinguish **follicular adenoma** from **follicular carcinoma** because the diagnosis of carcinoma requires demonstration of **capsular/vascular invasion**, which can only be assessed on a **surgically excised** nodule.
  - Reporting/next steps: Results are categorized (e.g., **benign**, **indeterminate/AUS-FLUS**, **suspicious for neoplasm**, **malignant**) and guide management (e.g., **repeat FNA/molecular testing**, **lobectomy/hemithyroidectomy**, or **thyroidectomy ± node dissection**).
- **Clinical context**
  - Thyroid nodules are **common** (1–10% prevalence; more common in women), **~90% are benign**, and **>90%** of patients with thyroid cancer are **alive at 20 years**.
  - Surgery is generally reserved for nodules proven or strongly suspected to be **malignant**, nodules that are **symptomatic/growing**, or glands causing **compressive/cosmetic** concerns.
