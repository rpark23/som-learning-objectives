### Adrenal Pathophysiology

**1. Understand general features of adrenal steroid biosynthesis and congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH).**

Adrenal cortical hormones derive from cholesterol through zonal pathways that produce **mineralocorticoids**, **glucocorticoids**, and **adrenal androgens**. In CAH, inherited enzyme defects impair cortisol synthesis, causing life-threatening adrenal insufficiency that is treatable if recognized. The most common CAH is **21-hydroxylase deficiency (~1:15,000 births)**:
- Complete deficiency: inability to make both **cortisol** and **mineralocorticoids** → neonatal salt-wasting (dehydration), markedly elevated **ACTH**, and excess **adrenal androgens (DHEA, androstenedione)** causing virilization/ambiguous genitalia in XX infants.
- Partial deficiency (XX): adequate mineralocorticoids but androgen excess with virilization.
Other, rarer CAHs include **11β-hydroxylase**, **17α-hydroxylase**, and **3β-HSD** deficiencies; their clinical features can be reasoned from the blocked steps and resulting hormone excess/deficiency.

**2. Understand regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.**

The **hypothalamus** secretes **CRH**, stimulating pituitary **ACTH**, which drives **cortisol** synthesis in the zona fasciculata. **Cortisol exerts negative feedback** on both ACTH and CRH. The axis is modulated by **stress, hypoglycemia, emotion (limbic), and diurnal rhythm**. In primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison’s), damaged adrenal cortex yields low cortisol despite high ACTH; in secondary adrenal insufficiency (low ACTH), glucocorticoids fall but **aldosterone is preserved** because it is regulated by **angiotensin II (RAAS)**.

**3. Understand the different potencies of glucocorticoids (GCs) and mineralocorticoids (MCs).**

GC/MC potency depends on **steroid structure**, **receptor affinity**, **metabolic clearance**, and **binding to corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG)**. Key clinical points:
- **Cortisol = hydrocortisone** (same molecule).
- **Dexamethasone** is ~**30×** more potent (mg per mg) for GC activity versus cortisol.
- **Fludrocortisone (9α-fluorocortisol)** is ~**500×** more potent (mg per mg) for MC activity versus cortisol.
At high doses, cortisol’s MR activity can cause **Na+ and water retention** and **hypertension**. GC biological effects include increased **gluconeogenesis**, **glycogenolysis**, **insulin resistance**, **proteolysis** (muscle wasting, negative nitrogen balance), regulation of **vascular tone**, and with chronic excess, **immunosuppression**, **central fat deposition** (omentum, supraclavicular/dorsal pads), **reduced bone formation/wound healing/muscle mass**, and **mood/cognitive changes**.

**4. Recognize clinical manifestations and diagnostic work-up of glucocorticoid excess (Cushing’s syndrome).**

Typical features include **hypertension**, **diabetes**, **muscle wasting** with proximal weakness, **depression**, **acne**, **immunocompromise**, **osteoporosis**, and widespread **striae** (e.g., axillae/abdomen). Causes of endogenous Cushing’s:
- **Pituitary adenoma (Cushing’s disease)** ~70%
- **Adrenal disease** ~17% (adenoma ~10%, carcinoma ~7%)
- **Ectopic ACTH** ~12%
Screening:
- **24-hour urinary free cortisol (UFC)**: Cushing’s usually >**100 mcg/24h**.
- **Overnight 1 mg dexamethasone test**: normal suppresses morning cortisol to <**1.8 mcg/dL**; failure to suppress suggests Cushing’s.
Etiologic testing:
- **Plasma ACTH**: very low → adrenal tumor or exogenous steroids (ACTH suppressed); high/normal → proceed to **inferior petrosal sinus sampling** to confirm pituitary source versus ectopic ACTH.
- **Imaging**: **MRI/CT** of pituitary, adrenals, and suspected ectopic sites (e.g., small cell lung).

**5. Recognize clinical manifestations and diagnostic work-up of glucocorticoid deficiency (Addison’s disease and others).**

Common manifestations: **weight loss**, **fatigue**, **orthostatic symptoms/hypotension**, and in primary disease, **hyperpigmentation** (from elevated **POMC/ACTH** producing melanocytic peptides). Laboratory findings in primary adrenal insufficiency: **hyponatremia**, **hyperkalemia**, **metabolic acidosis**; less commonly **hypoglycemia** and **hypercalcemia**. In secondary adrenal insufficiency (low ACTH), **mineralocorticoid function is preserved** via **RAAS**, so patients typically lack hyperkalemia/metabolic acidosis and have more normal volume status. Hyperpigmentation is absent in secondary forms.

**6. Understand that cortisol binds both glucocorticoid (GR) and mineralocorticoid (MR) receptors, but MR is normally protected by 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD).**

Cortisol has high affinity for both **GR** and **MR**, but in the kidney, **11β-HSD2** converts active **cortisol (11-hydroxy)** to inactive **cortisone (11-keto)**, thereby protecting MR from cortisol. **11β-HSD1** can convert cortisone back to cortisol in other tissues. When cortisol is excessive or **11β-HSD2 is defective**:
- Cortisol activates MR → **mineralocorticoid excess phenotype**: **volume expansion**, **hypertension**, **hypokalemia**, **metabolic alkalosis**.
- The **syndrome of apparent mineralocorticoid excess (AME)** is an autosomal recessive 11β-HSD2 deficiency.
- Ingestion of large amounts of **black licorice (glycyrrhizic acid)** inhibits 11β-HSD2 and can mimic AME.

**7. Recognize and understand endocrine causes of hypertension.**

- **Renin–angiotensin–aldosterone (RAA) system**: Renal **juxtaglomerular cells** release **renin** (via pressure/volume, macula densa, and β1-sympathetic input) → **angiotensin II** (ACE) → adrenal zona glomerulosa **aldosterone** → increased **ENaC**-mediated Na+ reabsorption, enhanced **ROMK** K+ secretion, and **H+-ATPase**-mediated H+ secretion.
- **Primary hyperaldosteronism (Conn’s syndrome)**:
  - Pathophysiology: autonomous aldosterone causes **Na+ retention**, **K+ loss**, **H+ excretion** → modest **volume expansion**, **hypertension**, **hypokalemia**, **metabolic alkalosis**; **renin is suppressed**.
  - Etiologies: **aldosterone-producing adenoma (aldosteronoma, “Conn’s disease”)**, bilateral glomerulosa **hyperplasia**, rarer MC excess causes.
  - Diagnosis: Use **aldosterone/renin ratio** (elevated aldosterone with suppressed renin) as a sensitive, specific screen; confirm and lateralize with **imaging** and **adrenal venous sampling** to determine unilateral (surgical) vs bilateral (medical) disease.
  - Clinical nuance: Despite volume expansion, frank edema is uncommon due to **escape** from sodium retention.
- **Cushing’s syndrome**:
  - Hypertension mechanisms: **glucocorticoid augmentation of α-adrenergic activity**; **overwhelmed 11β-HSD2** allowing cortisol to activate MR (volume expansion); and, in some tumors, co-secretion of **mineralocorticoids**.
- **Rare causes (pseudohyperaldosteronism and others)**:
  - **Liddle’s syndrome**: gain-of-function **ENaC** activity (reduced channel degradation) → increased Na+ uptake, K+/H+ loss; looks like MC excess but **aldosterone is low**.
  - **Apparent mineralocorticoid excess (AME)**: **11β-HSD2 deficiency** or **licorice** ingestion → cortisol activates MR.
  - **Glucocorticoid-remediable hyperaldosteronism**: **fusion gene** (11β-hydroxylase–aldosterone synthase) causes **ACTH-driven aldosterone** production in zona fasciculata; treatable with glucocorticoids.
- **Pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma**:
  - Catecholamine-producing tumors from adrenal medulla or sympathetic ganglia cause paroxysmal or sustained **severe hypertension** (crises up to 200–240/120–180) with **headache, palpitations, diaphoresis**, and additional neuro/autonomic symptoms.
  - Biochemical testing targets metabolites: **plasma metanephrines/normetanephrines** and **24-hour urine VMA**; multiple tests improve sensitivity/specificity.
  - Genetics in 20–30%: associated with **MEN 2A (RET)**, **VHL**, **NF1**, and **SDH** mutations.
