### Lecture 15: Metabolic Bone Physiology and Pathophysiology II

**1. Define osteoporosis.**

Osteoporosis is a disease of “porous bone” characterized by a reduction in **bone mineral density (BMD)** and **bone mass** with compromised **bone structure and strength**, leading to increased **fracture risk**. In osteoporosis, bone composition and **mineralization are intact**; the primary problem is that the overall amount of bone is reduced, weakening the skeleton. It is a **silent disease** until a fracture occurs and carries a high clinical and economic burden: about **50% of women** and **25% of men** over 50 will sustain an osteoporotic fracture, hip-fracture mortality exceeds **20–25%** in the first year, and all fractures increase morbidity and functional decline.

**2. Describe ways to assess fracture risk.**

Fracture risk assessment integrates bone density measurement with clinical risk factors.

- Bone densitometry:
  - Measured by **DXA** at the **lumbar spine (L1–L4)**, **hip** (femoral neck, total hip), and **1/3 forearm**, reported in g/cm².
  - Bone compartments: the **lumbar spine** is mostly **trabecular** bone; the **1/3 forearm** is mostly **cortical**; hip sites are mixed.
  - Scores:
    - **T-score** compares BMD to young-adult peak bone mass (for postmenopausal women and men ≥50).
    - **Z-score** compares BMD to age-matched peers (used in younger individuals).
  - WHO categories (intended for epidemiology): Normal (>−1), “Low bone density/osteopenia” (−1 to −2.5), **Osteoporosis (≤−2.5)**. Fracture risk, however, rises continuously as BMD declines—two people with the same T-score can have very different risks depending on other factors.

- Clinical risk factors and tools:
  - **FRAX**: a multivariable model that predicts 10-year risk of hip and major osteoporotic fractures using **BMD plus clinical risk factors** (e.g., age, prior fracture). Incorporating FRAX improves individual risk prediction over T-scores alone.
  - **Screening**: universally recommended for **women ≥65**; also for **men ≥70**, and postmenopausal women or men >50 with risk factors (e.g., prior fragility fracture, ≥3 months of **glucocorticoids**, secondary causes).
  - **Treatment thresholds (BHOF/NOF)**: treat if T-score ≤−2.5; or if low BMD plus a prior fracture, a secondary cause, or **FRAX** 10-year risk ≥3% for hip or ≥20% for major osteoporotic fracture; or any **hip or vertebral fracture** (including morphometric).

**3. Describe approaches to treating osteoporosis.**

Treatment reduces fracture risk through nutrition, exercise, and medications that either reduce resorption or build bone.

- Nutrition:
  - **Vitamin D RDA**: up to 70 years: **600 IU/day**; ≥71 years: **800 IU/day**.
  - **Calcium RDA**: up to 50 years: **1000 mg/day**; 50–70: **1000 mg (men)**, **1200 mg (women)**; ≥71: **1200 mg/day**. Needs rise with age due to reduced intestinal absorption, renal function, and cutaneous vitamin D synthesis.

- Exercise:
  - Combine **weight-bearing/impact** activities, **progressive resistance training** (≥2 sessions/week), and **balance training**. These approaches improve BMD and reduce falls; programs should be individualized and progressed safely.

- Antiresorptive medications:
  - **Bisphosphonates** (oral: alendronate, risedronate, ibandronate; IV: zoledronic acid):
    - Mechanism: bind bone, taken up by **osteoclasts**, inhibit **FPP synthase**, impair prenylation, reduce function, and increase apoptosis.
    - Efficacy: alendronate/risedronate reduce **vertebral and hip fractures 40–50%**; IV **zoledronic acid** reduces vertebral **70%**, hip **40%**, non-vertebral **25%**.
    - Practical points: oral agents have complex empty-stomach dosing and **GI side effects**; IV avoids GI effects but can cause an acute-phase reaction after first dose. Require **adequate renal function** (eGFR ≥30 mL/min).
    - Rare risks: **osteonecrosis of the jaw (<0.5%)**, **atypical femur fractures (~1/20,000 pt‑years)**.
    - Use strategy: finite courses (e.g., 3–5 years) followed by a **medication holiday** with monitoring; longer in high-risk patients.
  - **Denosumab** (anti-**RANKL** monoclonal antibody):
    - Dosing: **60 mg SC every 6 months**.
    - Efficacy: reduces **vertebral 68%**, **hip 40%**, **non-vertebral 20%**.
    - Considerations: usable at any **renal function**; risks include **hypocalcemia** (especially in renal disease) and infections; shares rare ONJ/AFF risks with bisphosphonates.
    - Critical: effect is **rapidly reversible**; upon stopping, transition to a **bisphosphonate** is required to prevent rebound fractures.
  - Other antiresorptive:
    - **Calcitonin** (nasal): modest vertebral fracture reduction; sometimes used for **vertebral pain**.
    - **Raloxifene** (SERM): reduces **vertebral fractures ~30%**; no hip benefit; reduces risk of **invasive breast cancer** in high-risk postmenopausal women.

- Anabolic medications:
  - Physiology: **intermittent PTH** exposure preferentially increases **bone formation**; continuous PTH increases **resorption**.
  - **Teriparatide (PTH 1–34)**: daily SC; reduces vertebral **77%** and non-vertebral **53%**; side effects include **hypercalcemia**.
  - **Abaloparatide (PTHrP analog)**: daily SC; reduces vertebral **86%**, non-vertebral **43%**; may cause less hypercalcemia than teriparatide.
  - **Romosozumab** (anti-**sclerostin**; Wnt pathway activator): monthly for 12 months; rapidly increases BMD; reduces vertebral **73%** (and non-vertebral ~25%); must be followed by an **antiresorptive**; current approval in women.

- Biologic coupling:
  - **RANKL–RANK–OPG** axis regulates osteoclastogenesis; **denosumab** mimics **OPG** by binding **RANKL**.
  - Anabolic-first then antiresorptive sequencing can help consolidate gains.

**4. Describe the pathophysiology and treatment of osteomalacia/rickets.**

- Definitions and pathophysiology:
  - **Osteomalacia** (adults) and **rickets** (children) result from **decreased mineralization of newly formed osteoid**, leading to accumulation of un/undermineralized matrix. The lack of **hydroxyapatite** reduces skeletal rigidity and raises **fracture risk**.
  - In children (before epiphyseal closure), this causes **rickets** with characteristic deformities; in adults, structural deformity is absent but fragility is prominent.

- Clinical features:
  - Adults: **bone pain**, **waddling gait** from muscle weakness, elevated **alkaline phosphatase**, and **pseudofractures (Looser zones)** on x-ray (transverse lucencies with sclerotic margins).
  - Children: **lower extremity bowing** with weightbearing, **enlarged head**, **prominent costochondral joints**, **protuberant abdomen**; wrist x-rays show **cupping and fraying** of metaphyses.

- Causes:
  - **Vitamin D deficiency or resistance** (e.g., VDR or 1α‑hydroxylase defects) — most common.
  - **Inadequate calcium intake**.
  - **Hypophosphatemia** (e.g., renal phosphate wasting; severe malabsorption).
  - **Alkaline phosphatase deficiency** (**hypophosphatasia**) leading to accumulation of inorganic pyrophosphate, an inhibitor of mineralization.
  - **Inhibitors of mineralization** (e.g., fluoride; historical etidronate).

- Treatment:
  - Correct the underlying deficit: replete **vitamin D**, ensure adequate **calcium** and **phosphate**.
  - Address causes of phosphate wasting (e.g., tumor-induced osteomalacia).
  - For **hypophosphatasia**, **asfotase alfa** (enzyme replacement) is available.
  - Avoid agents that impair mineralization when possible.

**5. Describe the pathophysiology and treatment of Paget’s disease of bone.**

Paget’s disease features focal areas of **disorganized, high bone turnover** due to **osteoclast dysfunction**, affecting one (monostotic) or multiple (polyostotic) sites. Etiology is uncertain with roles for **genetic susceptibility**, possible **paramyxoviral** factors, and environmental influences; familial clustering and **SQSTM1 (p62)** mutations support a genetic component. The condition has become rare.

- Clinical presentation:
  - **Bone pain**, **deformities**, **fractures**, **hearing loss**, and **headache**; affected bone may be **warm** on exam due to hypervascularity.
  - Serum **alkaline phosphatase** is typically elevated; diagnosis is often prompted by this lab finding.

- Treatment:
  - **Bisphosphonates** are first-line; **IV zoledronic acid** is preferred and superior to oral agents, often inducing prolonged remission after a single infusion.
  - **Calcitonin** is an alternative but less potent.
  - Indications include **pain or deformity**, **hearing loss**, **lesions in weight-bearing bones**, **pre‑operative** optimization before orthopedic surgery, and **hypercalcemia**.

- Conceptual link:
  - High-turnover states highlight the coupling of **bone resorption and formation**; in rare juvenile forms with **OPG deficiency**, unopposed **RANKL** drives severe osteoclast activation and Paget‑like features, responding to antiresorptives.
