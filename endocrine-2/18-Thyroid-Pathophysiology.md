### Lecture: Thyroid Pathophysiology

**1. Know the clinical implications of thyroid anatomy.**

- The thyroid is highly vascular and lies adjacent to the **recurrent laryngeal nerves** and **parathyroid glands**, so thyroidectomy risks include **recurrent laryngeal nerve injury** (hoarseness/voice changes) and **hypoparathyroidism**, as well as bleeding.
- Its proximity to the **trachea** and **esophagus** means enlargement can cause **dyspnea** and **dysphagia**. Retrosternal goiters can produce thoracic inlet obstruction with **facial plethora**, **jugular venous compression**, and a positive **Pemberton sign** (“thyroid cork”).
- Anatomic variants (e.g., **pyramidal lobe**) and embryologic remnants (e.g., **thyroglossal duct cyst**) have surgical and diagnostic relevance.

**2. Describe thyroid hormone synthesis and regulation of thyroid function.**

- Synthesis occurs in follicular cells and involves:
  - Active iodide uptake via the **Na+/I− symporter (NIS)** (stimulated by **TSH** and TSH-receptor antibodies; inhibited by perchlorate; saturable with high iodine).
  - **Oxidation and organification** of iodide onto **thyroglobulin** tyrosyl residues by **thyroid peroxidase (TPO)** to form **MIT/DIT**.
  - **Coupling** of MIT and DIT to form **T3** and **T4**.
  - **Endocytosis** of thyroglobulin, **proteolysis**, and release of T3/T4; **deiodination** of MIT/DIT recycles iodide.
- Hormone characteristics: **T4** is the major secreted form (~90%), a **prohormone** converted peripherally to **T3** (~80% of T3 comes from deiodination). Half-lives differ markedly (**T4 ~7 days**, **T3 ~1 day**).
- Regulation:
  - **Iodine autoregulation**: deficiency increases TSH and goiter, shifts production toward **T3**; excess induces the **Wolff–Chaikoff effect** (transient organification block) with **escape** in 2–4 weeks (likely via reduced iodide trapping/NIS). Excess iodine can precipitate **Jod–Basedow** hyperthyroidism in toxic nodules; “escape” may fail in autoimmune thyroid disease.
  - **Hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis**: **TRH** stimulates **TSH**, which promotes thyroid growth, **iodine uptake**, synthesis, and hormone release; **T3/T4** provide negative feedback. TSH is inhibited by somatostatin, dopamine, and glucocorticoids. Activating/inactivating **TSHR mutations** alter function.

**3. Describe the effects of thyroid hormone and the clinical manifestations of thyroid dysfunction.**

- Cellular action: **T3** binds nuclear **thyroid hormone receptors (TRα, TRβ)**. Without ligand, TRs recruit corepressors; with ligand, they recruit coactivators to modulate gene transcription. Receptor isoforms are tissue-specific (e.g., **TRα** in heart/muscle/bone/GI; **TRβ1** in liver/kidney/brain; **TRβ2** in hypothalamus/pituitary), explaining organ-specific effects and phenotypes of **thyroid hormone resistance**.
- Physiologic actions:
  - **Growth/development**: brain myelination and cerebellar development; skeletal maturation.
  - **Metabolism**: ↑ **Na+/K+ ATPase**, ↑ **β-adrenergic receptor** number/function, ↑ O2 consumption, heat production, **basal metabolic rate**; ↑ intestinal glucose absorption, **gluconeogenesis**; effects on **cholesterol** synthesis/degradation and **lipolysis**.
- Clinical hyperthyroidism: **anxiety/insomnia**, weight loss, heat intolerance/sweating, **palpitations**, diarrhea, **tremor**, irregular menses; risks include **cardiac** and **bone** morbidity. In **Graves’ disease**, diffuse goiter, **ophthalmopathy** (periorbital edema, chemosis, proptosis; enlarged extraocular muscles), and pretibial dermopathy may be present.
- Clinical hypothyroidism: fatigue, **cold intolerance**, **weight gain**, constipation, heavy menses; exam may show **delayed relaxation of deep tendon reflexes**, goiter, and characteristic **facies** in severe cases.

**4. Discuss the conditions that can cause thyroid dysfunction.**

- Hyperthyroidism:
  - Increased synthesis: **Graves’ disease** (TSH receptor–stimulating antibodies), **toxic multinodular goiter**, **toxic adenoma**, **TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma**, high **hCG** states (pregnancy, trophoblastic/testicular tumors).
  - Release/destructive or extrathyroidal: **subacute (granulomatous) thyroiditis**, painless/postpartum/drug-induced thyroiditis, radiation/trauma-induced thyroiditis, **exogenous** thyroid hormone, **ectopic** production (struma ovarii, metastatic follicular carcinoma), **iodine-mediated** (contrast, amiodarone).
- Hypothyroidism:
  - **Primary (>95%)**: autoimmune (Hashimoto’s), iatrogenic (surgery/RAI), iodine **deficiency** or **excess**, medications (e.g., amiodarone, lithium), infiltrative diseases, congenital.
  - **Central (<5%)**: pituitary (secondary) or hypothalamic (tertiary).
  - Very rare: **thyroid hormone resistance**.

**5. Be able to interpret basic thyroid function tests.**

- Core tests: **TSH** (best single test; **inverse logarithmic** relationship with FT4/FT3; highly sensitive) and **Free T4**. **Free T3** is useful in hyperthyroidism.
- Total vs free: **TT4/TT3** reflect binding proteins and may be misleading; **free hormones** are biologically active and regulate feedback.
- Binding proteins: **TBG** carries ~70% of circulating hormone; increases with **estrogen** (pregnancy, therapy) and hepatitis; decreases with androgens, glucocorticoids, and systemic illness. High TBG raises **TT4** but **FT4** remains normal; TBG deficiency lowers TT4 with normal FT4.
- Antibodies/markers: **Anti-TPO** and **anti-thyroglobulin** support autoimmune thyroid disease; **TSI** is positive in >90% of Graves’ (bioassay shows cAMP stimulation); **thyroglobulin (Tg)** is a tumor marker in differentiated thyroid cancer follow-up.
- Imaging:
  - **Radioiodine uptake/scan (I-123/I-131)**: normal 24-hr uptake ~8–30%; identifies diffuse uptake in Graves, focal “hot” nodules (with suppression of the rest of the gland), or low uptake in thyroiditis; uptake is reduced by competing **iodine** (diet/contrast/meds). Used diagnostically and therapeutically; relies on **NIS**.
  - **Ultrasound**: modality of choice for structural evaluation (nodules, cancer risk stratification).
- Special context: **Sick euthyroid syndrome** in serious illness shows low **T3**, high **rT3**, and in severe cases low **TSH/FT4**, with a transient **TSH rise** during recovery.

**6. Discuss the mechanism of action of antithyroid drugs.**

- **Thionamides**:
  - **Methimazole (MMI)** and **propylthiouracil (PTU)** inhibit **TPO**, blocking iodide oxidation, organification, and coupling (↓ new thyroid hormone synthesis).
  - **PTU** additionally inhibits peripheral **5′-deiodination** of T4→T3.
  - They may also reduce intrathyroidal immune activity.
- Key differences/adverse effects:
  - **MMI**: once-daily dosing; better overall side-effect profile; rare embryopathy if used in 1st trimester.
  - **PTU**: thrice-daily dosing; risk of serious **hepatotoxicity**; preferred in the 1st trimester and in thyroid storm (deiodinase effect).
  - Both: **rash**, **agranulocytosis** (urgent eval for fever/sore throat).

**7. Outline treatment steps for hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, thyroiditis, and thyroid cancer.**

- Hyperthyroidism:
  - Symptom control: **beta-blockers** (e.g., propranolol; also reduces T4→T3).
  - Antithyroid drugs: **MMI** (or **PTU** when indicated) for 12–18 months in Graves; ~30% chance of remission; relapse common.
  - Definitive therapy: **radioactive iodine (I-131) ablation** (gradual destruction; ~80% permanent hypothyroidism; may worsen ophthalmopathy) or **thyroidectomy** (consider risks: anesthesia, recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, hypoparathyroidism).
  - Additional blocks (selected scenarios): **perchlorate** (NIS), **lithium** (hormone release).
- Hypothyroidism:
  - **Levothyroxine (T4)** replacement ~**1.6–1.7 mcg/kg/day**; start full dose in young without cardiac disease; start low/go slow in the elderly or with coronary disease.
  - Reassess and titrate every **~6 weeks** (T4 half-life).
  - Separate LT4 from **calcium/iron/multivitamins/soy** by ≥4 hours.
  - In suspected central hypothyroidism, monitor **FT4** (target mid–high normal), not TSH. Evaluate **adrenal function** when indicated; treat adrenal insufficiency before starting LT4 to avoid **adrenal crisis**.
- Thyroiditis:
  - **Beta-blockers** for thyrotoxic symptoms; **thionamides are not beneficial** (hormone leak, not overproduction).
  - Painful subacute thyroiditis: **NSAIDs** (or glucocorticoids if severe).
  - Transient hypothyroid phase: short-term **LT4** if symptomatic.
- Thyroid nodules/cancer:
  - Initial nodule workup: check **TSH**. If low, perform **radioiodine uptake/scan** (hot nodules are rarely malignant). If TSH not low, proceed to **ultrasound** and **fine-needle aspiration** as indicated.
  - Differentiated thyroid cancer (**papillary/follicular**): **thyroidectomy** (hemi or total), selective **radioiodine ablation** (can use recombinant **TSH**), and **TSH suppression** with LT4; monitor **thyroglobulin**.
  - **Medullary**: consider MEN associations; monitor **calcitonin**. **Anaplastic**: aggressive, poor prognosis.
